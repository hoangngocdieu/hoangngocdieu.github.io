			<span class="postbody"><b>WPF Recipes in C# 2008: A Problem-Solution Approach</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51um0XqwNYL.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> WPF offers amazing new opportunities to .NET programmers in terms of the user interfaces they can deliver to their customers. But this significant technological advance comes with a steep learning curve, requiring the programmer to learn new classes, new syntax, and an entirely new approach to UI development.<br/><br/> Although WPF has been generally available for over a year, commercial take–up has been relatively slow, and the publicly available body of knowledge has been weak in terms of real–world examples and best–practice information.<br/><br/> Using WPF Recipes in C# 2008, you’ll find a simple and straightforward approach to solving the problems you face every day. Each solution contains a complete, working example that demonstrates how to make the best use of WPF. You can use the example as a template to solve your own problem or as a base on which to build a solution tailored to your specific needs.<br/><br/> Packed with well–structured and documented solutions to a broad range of common WPF problems, this book, which presents the only WPF recipes currently published, will be a valuable addition to any C# programmer’s reference library. Examples included provide you with a rich source of information as you begin to learn and will be an invaluable quick–reference guide once you’re a proficient WPF programmer.<br/><br/> The emphasis on solving the day–to–day WPF problems that all programmers face frees you from needing to trawl through weighty programming tomes or sift through API documentation, allowing you to focus on the more interesting and innovative aspects of your project.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn<br/><br/> * Get hands–on experience applying WPF to real–world business applications.<br/> * Find quick answers to common problems.<br/> * Develop a new mindset to UI development and a new approach to implementation from the authors’ experience in graphics.<br/> * Peruse clear and concise code samples that demonstrate solutions to specific problems.<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/> This book will benefit intermediate–to–advanced professional C# programmers who want clearly documented and working code samples that demonstrate solutions to common problems encountered when programming WPF. The authors believe WPF technology is new and complex enough, and their experience is deep enough that their recipes will provide value to all but the most experienced WPF programmers.<br/><br/> About the Apress Recipes Series<br/> Apress Recipes series books are carefully selected compendiums of solutions and techniques to help you solve the difficulties that regularly beset developers when they are learning a new language or technology. The recipes are short, and each provides a step–by–step explanation and working code example that allows you to successfully solve your problems and progress with your project.<br/><br/> URL :<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

			<span class="postbody"><b>Beginning C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RiVJc8qxL.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> This book is for anyone who wants to write good C# code—even if you have never programmed before. Writing good code can be a challenge—there are so many options, especially in a .NET language like C#. If you want to really get the best from a programming language, you need to know which features work best in which situations and understand their strengths and weaknesses. It is this understanding that makes the difference between coding and coding well.<br/><br/> Beginning C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition &lt;/em&gt; has been written to teach you how to use the C# programming language to solve problems. From the earliest chapters, and from the first introductory concepts, you’ll be looking at real–world programming challenges and learning how C# can be used to overcome them. As you progress through the book, the problems become more involved and interesting, while the solutions become correspondingly more complex and powerful as C# features interact to achieve the results that you want.<br/><br/> This second edition has been revised and improved to now include the latest SQL Server 2008 release and explain how you can integrate SQL Server 2008 with your C# applications.<br/><br/> By the time you’ve finished reading this book and worked through the sample exercises, you’ll be a confident and very competent C# programmer. You will still have many explorations of the .NET Framework API to look forward to, but you will have a firm foundation to build from, and you will know exactly where to go to find the things that you need to progress confidently in your projects.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn<br/> * Everything to get you started with C# 2008 from scratch—from installing the tools to writing your first applications.<br/> * The core concepts of .NET 3.5 programming: from decision trees to data structures, from exceptions to lambda expressions, and from objects to components.<br/> * Learn what LINQ is, why functional programming can be important, how generics make your life easier, and much, much, more!<br/><br/> Who is this book for<br/> This book is for anyone who’s just starting out to learn about C#. It doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of object–oriented programming, of the .NET Framework, or of coding in general. It simply assumes that you’re an intelligent person who wants to learn and starts the journey from there.<br/><br/> About the Apress Beginning Series<br/> The Beginning series from Apress is the right choice to get the information you need to land that crucial entry–level job. These books will teach you a standard and important technology from the ground up because they are explicitly designed to take you from “novice to professional.” You’ll start your journey by seeing what you need to know—but without needless theory and filler. You’ll build your skill set by learning how to put together real–world projects step by step. So whether your goal is your next career challenge or a new learning opportunity, the Beginning series from Apress will take you there—it is your trusted guide through unfamiliar territory!<br/><br/><br/> URL :<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5179vgxUPqL.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> The Definitive Guide to SOA: Oracle® Service Bus, Second Edition targets professional software developers and architects who know enterprise development but are new to enterprise service buses (ESBs) and service–oriented architecture (SOA) development. This is the first book to cover a practical approach to SOA using the BEA AquaLogic Service Bus tool. And it’s written from the “source”—BEA Systems AquaLogic product lead Jeff Davies<br/><br/> * This book provides hands–on information to developing SOA–driven applications with ESBs as central components.<br/> * It also gives strategic guidance on SOA planning, web service life–cycle management, administration of an ESB, and security considerations.<br/> * Author Jeff Davies is careful to cut through theory and get straight to demonstrating successful use of the product.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn<br/> * View code examples that demonstrate how to use the major features of the service bus.<br/> * Learn tips and tricks to solve common problems.<br/> * Change your thinking on versioning web services: instead of applying versions to web services, which the author feels is simply the wrong tool for managing service life cycle, learn a new way to manage the service life cycle.<br/> * Get a new perspective on planning your “service landscape.”<br/> * Discover administration–specific details for keeping your ESB running with practical advice on moving your configurations from development to testing and production—details that are commonly omitted from technical books.<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/> This book is for developers, technical architects, tech leads, professional software developers ,and architects. It’s targeted at folks who know enterprise development but are new to enterprise service buses and SOA development.<br/><br/> URL :<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i26.tinypic.com/2i9379.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> “This book’s broad overview can help an organization choose a set of<br/> processes, policies, and techniques that are appropriate for its<br/> security maturity, risk tolerance, and development style. This book will<br/> help you understand how to incorporate practical security techniques<br/> into all phases of the development lifecycle.”<br/><br/> –Steve Riley, senior security strategist, Microsoft Corporation<br/><br/> “There are books written on some of the topics addressed in this book,<br/> and there are other books on secure systems engineering. Few address the<br/> entire life cycle with a comprehensive overview and discussion of<br/> emerging trends and topics as well as this one.”<br/> –Ronda Henning, senior scientist-software/security queen, Harris<br/> Corporation<br/><br/> Software that is developed from the beginning with security in mind will<br/> resist, tolerate, and recover from attacks more effectively than would<br/> otherwise be possible. While there may be no silver bullet for security,<br/> there are practices that project managers will find beneficial. With<br/> this management guide, you can select from a number of sound practices<br/> likely to increase the security and dependability of your software, both<br/> during its development and subsequently in its operation.<br/><br/> Software Security Engineering draws extensively on the systematic<br/> approach developed for the Build Security In (BSI) Web site. Sponsored<br/> by the Department of Homeland Security Software Assurance Program, the<br/> BSI site offers a host of tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and<br/> other resources to help project managers address security issues in<br/> every phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC). The book’s<br/> expert authors, themselves frequent contributors to the BSI site,<br/> represent two well-known resources in the security world: the CERT<br/> Program at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and Cigital, Inc., a<br/> consulting firm specializing in software security.<br/><br/> This book will help you understand why<br/> - Software security is about more than just eliminating<br/> vulnerabilities and conducting penetration tests<br/> - Network security mechanisms and IT infrastructure security services<br/> do not sufficiently protect application software from security risks<br/> - Software security initiatives should follow a risk-management<br/> approach to identify priorities and to define what is “good<br/> enough”–understanding that software security risks will change<br/> throughout the SDLC<br/> - Project managers and software engineers need to learn to think like<br/> an attacker in order to address the range of functions that software<br/> should not do, and how software can better resist, tolerate, and recover<br/> when under attack<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

			<span class="postbody"><b>Refactoring HTML: Improving the Design of Existing Web Applications</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i31.tinypic.com/2aain91.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> “Wow, what a compendium of great information and how-to’s! I am so<br/> impressed! Elliotte’s written a book whose title comes nowhere near to<br/> doing it justice. Covering much more than just refactoring, this book<br/> explains how to do it right the first time around, in a clear and lucid<br/> voice. Harold obviously knows his stuff. A must-read!”<br/> —Howard Katz, Proprietor, Fatdog Software<br/><br/> “After working with people who require the skills and tools necessary<br/> to continually improve the quality and security of their applications, I<br/> have discovered a missing link. The ability to rebuild and recode<br/> applications is a key area of weakness for web designers and web<br/> application developers alike. By building refactoring into the<br/> development process, incremental changes to the layout or internals<br/> efficiently averts a total rewrite or complete make-over. This is a<br/> fantastic book for anyone who needs to rebuild, recode, or refactor the<br/> web.”<br/> —Andre Gironda, tssci-security.com<br/><br/> “Elliotte’s book provides a rare collection of hints and tricks that<br/> will vastly improve the quality of web pages. Virtually any serious HTML<br/> developer, new or tenured, in any size organization will reap tremendous<br/> benefit from implementing even a handful of his suggestions.”<br/> —Matt Lavallee, Development Manager, MLS Property Information Network,<br/> Inc. Like any other software system, Web sites gradually accumulate<br/> “cruft” over time. They slow down. Links break. Security and<br/> compatibility problems mysteriously appear. New features don’t integrate<br/> seamlessly. Things just don’t work as well. In an ideal world, you’d<br/> rebuild from scratch. But you can’t: there’s no time or money for that.<br/> Fortunately, there’s a solution: You can refactor your Web code using<br/> easy, proven techniques, tools, and recipes adapted from the world of<br/> software development. In Refactoring HTML, Elliotte Rusty Harold<br/> explains how to use refactoring to improve virtually any Web site or<br/> application. Writing for programmers and non-programmers alike, Harold<br/> shows how to refactor for better reliability, performance, usability,<br/> security, accessibility, compatibility, and even search engine<br/> placement. Step by step, he shows how to migrate obsolete code to<br/> today’s stable Web standards, including XHTML, CSS, and REST—and<br/> eliminate chronic problems like presentation-based markup, stateful<br/> applications, and “tag soup.”<br/><br/> The book’s extensive catalog of detailed refactorings and practical<br/> “recipes for success” are organized to help you find specific solutions<br/> fast, and get maximum benefit for minimum effort. Using this book, you<br/> can quickly improve site performance now—and make your site far easier<br/> to enhance, maintain, and scale for years to come. Topics covered<br/> include<br/><br/> •&nbsp;Recognizing the “smells” of Web code that should be refactored<br/> • Transforming old HTML into well-formed, valid XHTML, one step at a<br/> time<br/> •&nbsp;Modernizing existing layouts with CSS<br/> • Updating old Web applications: replacing POST with GET, replacing<br/> old contact forms, and refactoring JavaScript<br/> •&nbsp;Systematically refactoring content and links<br/> • Restructuring sites without changing the URLs your users rely upon<br/> This book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,<br/> developers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates<br/> existing sites. It will be especially helpful to Web professionals who<br/> learned HTML years ago, and want to refresh their knowledge with today’s<br/> standards-compliant best practices.

But if all the<br/> talk of APIs and complex code leaves you cold, you’ll be pleased to meet<br/> Microsoft Popfly. Popfly was created as a tool for designers to build<br/> mashups in a visual manner, rapidly, without needing to know any code.<br/> By simply dragging out “blocks” that represent services such as Flickr<br/> onto your workspace and then drawing connection lines between them, you<br/> can create a mashup. It’s as easy as that!<br/><br/> Get Popfly and Silverlight up and running on your computer, and then<br/> learn how to use the Popfly Mashup Creator and Popfly Web Page Creator<br/> to share your mashups with the world. Author Eric Griffin will introduce<br/> you to Popfly and show you everything you need to start creating your<br/> own hybrid web applications.<br/><br/> - Build mashups visually without the need to know any code.<br/> - Leverage technologies such as Flickr and Google Maps.<br/> - Save your creation as a Vista Sidebar Gadget.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn:<br/><br/> - How to get Popfly and Silverlight up and running on your computer<br/> - How to use the Popfly Mashup Creator<br/> - How to combine blocks to create mashups<br/> - How to create web pages in the Popfly Web Page Creator<br/> - How to share your mashups with the world<br/> - How to save your mashups on your Vista desktop<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i32.tinypic.com/21e4xp5.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Web applications no longer need be powered by any one individual's data,<br/> and they don't need to be confined to the desktop. Developers can draw<br/> on a wealth of publicly available content, from providers such as<br/> Flickr, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Last.fm, and combine it for use in<br/> their own applications. Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) makes it simple<br/> to bring previously web-only applications to the desktop, allowing them<br/> to run alongside traditional applications on an end user's computer. In<br/> this book, you'll learn how to create mashup applications from the vast<br/> array of web services, feeds, and APIs using Adobe Flash and Flex<br/> together with HTML and JavaScript (Ajax). You'll be introduced to the<br/> various sources of information and the tools necessary to gather and<br/> reuse that information, and then you'll learn how to combine that<br/> content in a variety of ways. You'll learn how to have desktop<br/> applications interact with online services such as Flickr, you'll learn<br/> how to use Amazon S3 for enterprise-level data storage, and you'll<br/> embrace technologies such as OpenID. In addition, you'll create abstract<br/> visualizations based on music sourced from Last.fm and consume Twitter<br/> content via RSS. You will also see how to use the Flash-native data<br/> format SWX along with PHP to create a Yahoo! weather widget. You'll<br/> discover just why you may want to build a widget or a desktop<br/> application rather leaving things web-based; then you'll create an<br/> application using Flex Builder and AIR and learn how best to distribute<br/> it. With so many tools and so much data available, the possibilities for<br/> mashup creation are endless. Creating Mashups with Adobe Flex and AIR<br/> provides all you need to get you up and running quickly, while also<br/> giving you a solid understanding of the technologies involved so you can<br/> take things furtherto a place limited only by your imagination.<br/><br/> In this book you'll learn:<br/><br/> - how to use Flex 3 in conjunction with ActionScript 3.0 to build<br/> powerful applications;<br/> - how you can use Adobe AIR to take your application from the Web and<br/> onto the desktop;<br/> - the differences between developing for the Web and for the desktop;<br/> - how you can use the APIs of popular web services such as Flickr,<br/> Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Last.fm as data sources for your<br/> application; and<br/> - how to optimize your applications for fast and efficient<br/> performance.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

Add this book to the mix, and there's no limit to the powerful, interactive Web sites that developers can create. With step-by-step instructions, complete scripts, and expert tips to guide readers, veteran author and database designer Larry Ullman gets right down to business: After grounding readers with separate discussions of first the scripting language (PHP) and then the database program (MySQL), he goes on to cover security, sessions and cookies, and using additional Web tools, with several sections devoted to creating sample applications. This guide is indispensable for intermediate- to advanced level Web designers who want to replace their static sites with something dynamic. In this edition, the bulk of the new material covers the latest versions of both technologies: PHP 6 (due out in 2008) and MySQL 5 (available now). The book's publication date is likely to beat the official release of PHP 6, making it one of the first books available on the subject.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

In this practical,<br/> example-driven book, one of the world’s most experienced Linux driver<br/> developers systematically demonstrates how to develop reliable Linux<br/> drivers for virtually any device. Essential Linux Device Drivers is for<br/> any programmer with a working knowledge of operating systems and C,<br/> including programmers who have never written drivers before.<br/> Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran focuses on the essentials, bringing together<br/> all the concepts and techniques you need, while avoiding topics that<br/> only matter in highly specialized situations. Venkateswaran begins by<br/> reviewing the Linux 2.6 kernel capabilities that are most relevant to<br/> driver developers. He introduces simple device classes; then turns to<br/> serial buses such as I2C and SPI; external buses such as PCMCIA, PCI,<br/> and USB; video, audio, block, network, and wireless device drivers;<br/> user-space drivers; and drivers for embedded Linux–one of today’s<br/> fastest growing areas of Linux development. For each, Venkateswaran<br/> explains the technology, inspects relevant kernel source files, and<br/> walks through developing a complete example.<br/><br/> • Addresses drivers discussed in no other book, including drivers for<br/> I2C, video, sound, PCMCIA, and different types of flash memory<br/> • Demystifies essential kernel services and facilities, including kernel<br/> threads and helper interfaces<br/> • Teaches polling, asynchronous notification, and I/O control<br/> • Introduces the Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol for embedded Linux<br/> drivers<br/> • Covers multimedia device drivers using the Linux-Video subsystem and<br/> Linux-Audio framework<br/> • Shows how Linux implements support for wireless technologies such as<br/> Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi, and cellular networking<br/> • Describes the entire driver development lifecycle, through debugging<br/> and maintenance<br/> • Includes reference appendixes covering Linux assembly, BIOS calls, and<br/> Seq files<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

			<span class="postbody"><b> Java CAPS Basics: Implementing Common EAI Patterns (Hardcover)</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i29.tinypic.com/qoxdp5.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Use Java CAPS to Streamline IT Services and Leverage Legacy Applications<br/> Design patterns are a useful tool for streamlining enterprise<br/> integration and Web development projects: the mission-critical projects<br/> that directly impact your competitiveness. Enterprise Integration<br/> Patterns by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison-Wesley, 2004)<br/> described many of the most useful patterns for enterprise developers.<br/> Until recently, however, implementing the patterns in that classic<br/> reference required the extensive use of raw Java code. Now there’s a<br/> better alternative: Using Sun’s Java Composite Application Suite (Java<br/> CAPS), architects and developers can implement enterprise integration<br/> patterns succinctly, elegantly, and completely. In Java™ CAPS Basics,<br/> Sun’s own Java CAPS experts show how to quickly put these new tools and<br/> technologies to work in your real-world enterprise application<br/> integration projects. After reviewing the challenges of enterprise<br/> integration, they introduce Java CAPS and show how it can simplify the<br/> development of today’s state-of-the-art “composite” applications. Next,<br/> they bridge the gap between abstract pattern languages and practical<br/> implementation details. You will learn essential Java CAPS concepts and<br/> methods in the context of the patterns you’ll actually use for<br/> real-world message and system management. Coverage includes<br/> - Comparing approaches to enterprise application integration and<br/> finding ways to integrate non-invasively, with fewer changes and lower<br/> costs<br/> - Mastering the core integration tools provided by Java CAPS: eGate,<br/> eInsight, eWays and JMS<br/> - Using enterprise integration patterns to improve application<br/> reusability, scalability, resilience, security, and manageability<br/> - Implementing patterns for message exchange, correlation,<br/> infrastructure, routing, construction, transformation, and endpoints<br/> - Generating and using cryptographic objects such as X.509<br/> Certificates, PKCS#12, and JKS Keystores<br/> - Using advanced techniques such as solution partitioning and<br/> subprocess implementation, many of which are covered nowhere else<br/> - Constructing two complete example solutions that bring together many<br/> of the patterns discussed and illustrated in this book The companion CD<br/> contains detailed illustrations for most of the relevant patterns and<br/> two complete Java CAPS-based case studies (with solutions) that<br/> implement a number of the patterns discussed in the book. In addition,<br/> Part II contains a chapter on cryptographic objects used to configure<br/> security-related aspects of the suite. It also provides more than sixty<br/> detailed examples designed to illustrate the concepts and patterns<br/> presented in this book. Built with JCAPS eDesigner, these graphical,<br/> component-based examples can easily be used by business analysts and<br/> others with or without strong coding skills.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>
