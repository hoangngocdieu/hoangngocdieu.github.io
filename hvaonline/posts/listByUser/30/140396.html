Authors of the best papers and presentations from the conferences were invited to contribute to Research Learning in Virtual Worlds, the first book to specifically address research methods and related issues for education in virtual worlds.<br/><br/> The book covers a range of research undertaken in virtual worlds. It opens with an accessible introduction both to the book and to the subject area, making it an ideal springboard for those who are new to research in this area. The subsequent ten chapters present work covering a range of research methodologies across a broad discipline base, providing essential reading for advanced undergraduate or postgraduate researchers working in education in virtual worlds, and engaging background material for researchers in similar and related disciplines.<br/><br/> link download<br/><br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/L7COJJTD/researchinglearninginvirtualworldshumancomputerinteractionseries.9781849960465.51571.pdf</span></span>

Written by educators and professionals at the forefront in this field, the book shows how informatics plays a central role in providing productive and efficient healthcare services.<br/><br/> After defining pharmacy informatics, the text explores the information and biomedical technologies that are the drivers of change. It then discusses the basics of maintaining the reliability and security of computers in a connected world, the need for standardization in the healthcare industry, and effective strategies for searching, evaluating, and managing the wide variety of information resources available today. The next section covers the types of information systems that exist in hospitals and pharmacies, including bar coding. The book then presents tools for evidence-based practice, computerized clinical pharmacokinetics methods, clinical decision support, and data mining methods to improve therapy, reduce adverse outcomes, and cut costs. The final section examines various developments driven by the Internet and how current informatics solutions must evolve to maximize their potential.<br/><br/> The continual growth and increasing complexity of therapeutic information necessitate new ways for effectively handling medical data and ultimately providing better patient care. This book discusses how these changes affect pharmacy students and practicing pharmacists, preparing them for what lies ahead in this evolving field.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/0BTQLG99/pharmacyinformatics.9781420071757.51601.pdf</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/4/4/12400/200/mastering-dojo-javascript-and-ajax-tools-for-great-web-experiences-pragmatic-programmers.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> The last couple of years have seen big changes in server-side web programming. Now it's the client's turn; Dojo is the toolkit to make it happen and Mastering Dojo shows you how.<br/><br/> Dojo is a set of client-side JavaScript tools that help you build better web applications. Dojo blurs the line between local, native applications and browser based applications; the browser becomes the user interface platform. "Modern" browsers provide an incomplete, inconvenient, and incompatible programming environment, but Dojo eliminates these problems. While there are many JavaScript libraries available, most focus on just one thing (for example, effects libraries, perceived JavaScript omissions, or HTML widgets). Dojo addresses all of these functional areas-and many others-extensively.<br/><br/> In Mastering Dojo, you'll get the whole story, from basic usage to advanced idioms. Mastering Dojo starts out with a fast moving tutorial that will give you techniques that you can start using right away. You'll learn all about Dojo Core--the foundation on which all things Dojo stand. See how you can modularize your project for development and automatically package your release for optimal download performance. You'll also learn how Dojo:<br/> # augments the core JavaScript library<br/> # fixes the event system<br/> # simplifies DOM programming<br/> # provides a complete class definition facility<br/> # includes a powerful remote scripting (XHR) framework<br/> # ... and much more.<br/><br/> You'll love using Dojo's HTML user interface control widget system, Dijit. See how to use over 40 widgets, including the rich yet easy-to-use tree and grid controls.<br/><br/> Finally, you'll get an in-depth look at how to design and build a single-page, rich Internet Application.<br/><br/> About the Author<br/> Craig Riecke is a Dojo committer and a writer and editor for the Book of Dojo, Dojo's online documentation. He is currently Manager of Application Development for CXtec in Syracuse, NY. While programming he listens to old, scratchy blues musicon his iPod. His motto is "I'd rather drink muddy water and sleep in a hollow log than write a redundant line of code."<br/><br/> Rawld Gill has served as chief architect of five major lines of commercial, enterprise- class software targeted at the pharmaceutical industry over the last 25 years. He co-invented the concept of distributed data collection for clinical trials. A former U.S. Air Force officer and instructor fighter pilot, he has logged more than 2000 hours in supersonic jet fighter aircraft.<br/><br/> Alex Russell is the project lead for The Dojo Toolkit and president of the Dojo Foundation.<br/><br/> download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/J8CFRZ1P/masteringdojojavascriptandajaxtoolsforgreatwebexperiencespragmaticprogrammers.9781934356111.32743.pdf</span><br/> </span>

Now, for the first time, there’s a complete, example-rich developer’s guide to Dojo and its growing library of prepackaged widgets. Reviewed and endorsed by the Dojo Foundation, the creators of Dojo, this book brings together all the hands-on guidance and tested code samples you need to succeed.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Expert Web developer James E. Harmon begins by demonstrating how to “Ajax-ify” existing applications and pages with Dojo, adding Ajax features such as client- and server-side validation as quickly and nondisruptively as possible. Next, he presents in-depth coverage of Dojo’s user interface, form, layout, and specialized Widgets, showing how they work and how to use them most effectively. Among the Widgets, he covers in detail: Date Pickers, Rich Text Editors, Combo Boxes, Expandable Outlines, and many others.<br/><br/><br/><br/> In conclusion, Harmon introduces the Dojo toolkit’s powerful capabilities for simplifying Ajax development. He thoroughly explains Dojo’s helper functions, shortcuts, and special methods, illuminating each feature with examples of the JavaScript problems it can solve. This section’s far-ranging coverage includes strings, JSON support, event handling, Ajax remoting, Dojo and the DOM, testing, debugging, and much more. All source code examples are provided on a companion Web site, including source code for a complete tutorial case study application.<br/><br/><br/> About the Author<br/><br/><br/> James E. Harmon is the President and Senior Instructor at Object Training Group in Chicago. He is an experienced developer who spent a majority of his career building large scale online applications at Accenture and for several other Web-centric consulting firms. He now specializes in training Java Developers to be more productive by using the latest technologies and frameworks.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The book’s web site is<span class="link"> http://www.ObjectTrainingGroup.com/dojobook.</span><br/><br/> link download<br/><br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/XBEFPM1U/dojousingthedojojavascriptlibrarytobuildajaxapplicationsdeveloperslibrary.9780132358040.33742.pdf</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/3/8/18396/200/why-does-emc2-and-why-should-we-care.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> The most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today’s leading scientists.<br/><br/> Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up Einstein’s most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine—which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang—Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.<br/><br/> Alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed. A collaboration between two of the youngest professors in the UK, Why Does E=mc2? promises to be one of the most exciting and accessible explanations of the theory of relativity in recent years.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/7ZJHOXKL/whydoesemc2andwhyshouldwecare.9780306817588.49985.pdf</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/4/2/11887/200/the-developers-guide-to-debugging.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> Software has bugs. Period.<br/><br/> That's true, unfortunately. Even the good old "hello, world" program, known to virtually every C and C++ programmer in the world, can be considered to be buggy. Developing software means having to deal with defects; old ones, new ones, ones you created yourself, and those that others brought to life. Software developers debug programs for a living.<br/><br/> Hence, good debugging skills are a must-have. That said, it is regrettable that debugging is hardly taught in engineering schools. That's how the idea for this book was born.<br/><br/> The Developer's Guide to Debugging is a book for both professional software developers seeking to broaden their skills and students that want to learn the tricks of the trade from the ground up. With small examples and exercises it is well suited to accompany a CS course or lecture. At the same time it can be used as a reference guide to address problems as the need arises.<br/><br/> This book goes beyond the level of simple source code debugging scenarios. In addition, it covers the most frequent real-world problems from the areas of program linking, memory access, parallel processing and performance analysis. The picture is completed by chapters covering static checkers and techniques to write code that leans well towards debugging.<br/><br/> While the focus lies on C and C++, the workhorses of the software industry, one can apply many techniques described in The Developer's Guide to Debugging to programs written in other languages.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/QK6OIJJZ/thedevelopersguidetodebugging.9781402055393.33350.pdf</span></span>

But the performance of these fuel cells critically depends on the materials used for the various cell components. Durability, water management, and reducing catalyst poisoning are important factors when selecting PEMFC materials.<br/><br/> Written by international PEMFC scientists and engineers from top-level organizations, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Materials Properties and Performance provides a single resource of information for understanding how to select and develop materials for improved PEMFC performance. The book focuses on the major components of the fuel cell unit, along with design and modeling aspects. It covers catalysts and catalyst layers, before discussing the key components of membranes, diffusion layers, and bipolar plates. The book also explores materials modeling for the PEMFC.<br/><br/><br/><br/> This volume assesses the current status of PEMFC fuel cell technology, research and development directions, and the scientific and engineering challenges facing the fuel cell community. It demonstrates how the production of a commercially viable PEMFC requires a compromise of materials with adequate properties, design interaction, and manufacturability.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/1Q19SQ3C/protonexchangemembranefuelcellsmaterialspropertiesandperformancegreenchemistryandchemicalengineering.9781439806647.51611.pdf</span></span>

With the the vast area of mobile technology research and application, the intention behind the creation of MobiSec was to make a small, but unique contribution to build a bridge between top-level research and large scale application of novel kinds of information security for mobile devices and communication.<br/><br/> The papers at MobiSec 2009 dealt with a broad variety of subjects ranging from issues of trust in and security of mobile devices and embedded hardware security, over efficient cryptography for resource-restricted platforms, to advanced applications such as wireless sensor networks, user authentication, and privacy in an environment of autonomously communicating objects. With hindsight a leitmotif emerged from these contributions, which corrobarated the idea behind MobiSec; a set of powerful tools have been created in various branches of the security discipline, which await combined application to build trust and security into mobile (that is, all future) networks, autonomous and personal devices, and pervasive applications<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/OKWNRXCO/securityandprivacyinmobileinformationandcommunicationsystemsfirstinternationalicstconferencemobisec2009.9783642044335.51575.pdf</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/0/e/18598/200/oxford-handbook-of-the-history-of-mathematics-oxford-handbooks.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> This Handbook explores the history of mathematics under a series of themes which raise new questions about what mathematics has been and what it has meant to practice it. It addresses questions of who creates mathematics, who uses it, and how. A broader understanding of mathematical practitioners naturally leads to a new appreciation of what counts as a historical source. Material and oral evidence isdrawn upon as well as an unusual array of textual sources. Further, the ways in which people have chosen to express themselves are as historically meaningful as the contents of the mathematics they have produced. Mathematics is not a fixed and unchanging entity. New questions, contexts, and applications all influence what counts as productive ways of thinking. Because the history of mathematics should interact constructively with other ways of studying the past, the contributors to this book come from a diverse range of intellectual backgrounds in anthropology, archaeology, art history, philosophy, and literature, as well as history of mathematics more traditionally understood.The thirty-six self-contained, multifaceted chapters, each written by a specialist, are arranged under three main headings: 'Geographies and Cultures', 'Peoples and Practices', and 'Interactions and Interpretations'. Together they deal with the mathematics of 5000 years, but without privileging the past three centuries, and an impressive range of periods and places with many points of cross-reference between chapters. The key mathematical cultures of North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and China are all represented here as well as areas which are not often treated in mainstream history of mathematics, such as Russia, the Balkans, Vietnam, and South America. A vital reference for graduates and researchers in mathematics, historians of science, and general historians.<br/><br/> link<br/><br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/1G1DIIAZ/oxfordhandbookofthehistoryofmathematicsoxfordhandbooks.9780199213122.51591.pdf</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/4/d/18597/200/php-5-e-commerce-development.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> The popularity of online shopping has increased dramatically over the past few years. There are plenty of options available if you not are planning to build your own e-commerce solution but sometimes it's better to use your own solutions. It may be easy to find an e-commerce system but when it comes to extending it or using it you might come across a lot of difficulties.<br/><br/> This book will show you how to create your own PHP framework that can be extended and used with ease, particularly for e-commerce sites. Using this framework you will be able to display and manage products, customize products, create wish-lists, make recommendations to customers based on previous purchases, send email notifications when certain products are in stock, rate the products online, and much more.<br/><br/> This book helps you build a Model-View-Controller style framework, which is then used to put together an e-commerce application. The framework contains template management, database management, and user authentication management. With core functionality in place, e-commerce-focused features are gradually added to the framework including products, categories, customizable products with different variations and customer input, wish-lists, recommendations, the shopping basket, and a complete order process.<br/><br/> At the end of the book, you will have an e-commerce architecture that will take you from viewing or searching for products, and adding them to your basket, through the checkout process and making payment for your order, to your order being dispatched. Focus is placed on flexibility, so that the framework can be extended as the needs of a particular store change, as illustrated by one of the appendices, which goes through the process of modifying the store to sell downloadable products, as well as physical ones.<br/><br/> Supplementary information, such as how to market and promote an online store, as well as take regular backups and perform maintenance is also covered, ensuring you have every chance of success with you own e-commerce framework backed store.<br/><br/> What you will learn from this book<br/><br/> * Plan and develop a flexible, scalable PHP framework with emphasis on e-commerce<br/> * Implement the Model-View-Controller architecture within the framework and learn how to use the registry design pattern to centralize core features<br/> * Allow customers to customize their purchase by selecting product attributes, uploading files, and supplying custom text<br/> * Offer attractive incentives to your customers in the form of discount codes<br/> * Protect your e-commerce framework by keeping and maintaining regular backups<br/> * Structure an extendable framework to build a custom e-commerce web site<br/> * Add features such as product ratings and reviews from customers to enhance user experience<br/> * Maintain your site using campaign monitor and CAPTCHA tools<br/> * Create a shopping basket, manage its contents, structure the checkout and order process<br/> * Filled with useful marketing, Search Engine Optimization, and customer retention tips<br/> * Create a PHP framework to power your web site with a range of e-commerce features<br/><br/> Approach<br/><br/> This is a fast-paced tutorial focusing on creating a framework and using it to build an online store through an ongoing case study. Later chapters include examples to illustrate how easily the framework can be adapted for different situations. The framework and code are enhanced and built upon with each chapter, adding more and more functionality.<br/><br/> Who this book is written for<br/><br/> If you are a web developer, or anyone looking to increase your understanding of e-commerce site development, this book is for you. Primarily aimed at PHP developers, it is suitable for any web developer interested in enhancing their e-commerce knowledge, or developers looking to move towards PHP.<br/><br/> Intermediate knowledge of PHP development and object-oriented programming is assumed, and basic knowledge of e-commerce principles will be of benefit too.<br/><br/> link download<br/><br/><span class="link"> http://www.spreadmyfiles.com/files/1MJIJDGT/php5ecommercedevelopment.9781847199645.51612.pdf</span><br/><br/><span class="link"> http://megashare.vn/dl.php/614036</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/d/8/18325/200/cisco-ios-xr-fundamentals.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> Over the last several years, fiscal discipline has really dominated the industry. Both consumers and businesses expect far more from their communications providers than they did just a few years ago. Offering simple telephone dial tone and an Internet connection are not going to be enough for success. At the same time, however, service providers want to continue to reduce their operational costs. As a result, one of the main challenges telecommunications companies now face is to find ways to cost effectively bring innovative services to their customers. These drivers are why most providers are working on transitioning their disparate legacy networks to one, unified, converged network infrastructure based on IP combined with Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS is a technology that translates various other telecommunications protocols, such as ATM or frame relay, so they can run over an IP-based network. By eliminating their multiple networks, service providers are greatly reducing their operational costs. And by moving to an IP/MPLS network, they can mix and match all communications types—voice, data, and video—into any service their customers might want.<br/><br/> We believe the CRS-1 will dramatically affect carriers and their capability to successfully transition to this new era in communications. Carriers worldwide are embracing convergence and almost unanimously agree that IP/MPLS is the foundation for their new infrastructures. The CRS-1 provides carriers the means to consolidate their networks in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible. Nothing on the market can match it in terms of scalability, reliability, and flexibility. It is a system that our service provider customers will be able to base their businesses on. And I firmly believe that carriers that deploy the CRS-1 will gain profound competitive advantage over their competition through operational efficiencies and service flexibility. As we like to point out, when service providers work with Cisco, they are not just working with a network equipment maker but, rather, a business partner.<br/><br/> link download<br/><br/><span class="link"> http://megashare.vn/dl.php/570598</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/b/7/18206/200/97-things-every-programmer-should-know-collective-wisdom-from-the-experts.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> Programmers have a lot on their minds . Programming languages, programming techniques, development environments, coding style, tools, development process, deadlines, meetings, software architecture, design patterns, team dynamics, code, requirements, bugs, code quality. And more. A lot. There is an art, craft, and science to programming that extends far beyond the program. The act of programming marries the discrete world of computers with the fluid world of human affairs. Programmers mediate between the negotiated and uncertain truths of business and the crisp, uncompromising domain of bits and bytes and higher constructed types.<br/><br/> With so much to know, so much to do, and so many ways of doing so, no single person or single source can lay claim to “the one true way.” Instead, 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know draws on the wisdom of crowds and the voices of experience to offer not so much a coordinated big picture as a crowdsourced mosaic of what every programmer should know. This ranges from code-focused advice to culture, from algorithm usage to agile thinking, from implementation know-how to professionalism, from style to substance.<br/><br/> The contributions do not dovetail like modular parts, and there is no intent that they should—if anything, the opposite is true. The value of each contribution comes from its distinctiveness. The value of the collection lies in how the contributions complement, confirm, and even contradict one another. There is no overarching narrative: it is for you to respond to, reflect on, and connect together what you read, weighing it against your own context, knowledge, and experience.<br/><br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://megashare.vn/dl.php/570423</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/8/f/11873/200/beginning-sql-server-2008-for-developers-from-novice-to-professional.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> SQL Server 2008 is a first–rate database management system. It offers more capability than any previous release of SQL Server. More than just a classic relational database management system, SQL Server 2008 includes exciting and powerful features that make it useful for everything from large corporate data warehouses to ad hoc departmental databases. You’ll find enhanced support for XML, new support for spatial data, transparent data encryption, a policy–based management system, and more.<br/><br/> Author and developer Robin Dewson will show you the way from beginner to SQL Server 2008 professional. Learn to install SQL Server 2008 and navigate around Management Studio before getting right to the heart of mastering fundamental SQL Server 2008 tasks: creating tables, storing data, securing data, and retrieving it again. Dewson ensures you’ll be fully prepared to use all the basics and create a solid foundation for your own projects.<br/><br/> Don’t forget about backups! Your database will house important data, so backing up is essential to protect yourself from inevitable hardware failure. Dewson walks you through SQL Server 2008’s easy–to–use backup and recovery feature set, giving you the grounding that you need in order to set up a reliable plan for recovery in your own environment.<br/><br/> Learn to use Transact–SQL, a full–blown procedural language that is built right into the database system. Transact–SQL is the key to unlocking everything that SQL Server 2008 has to offer. Using Transact–SQL, you can write centrally encapsulated business logic through the use of stored procedures, automatically trigger processing through the use of triggers, and manipulate data within the server without having to move data back and forth across the network.<br/><br/> Finally, you’ll learn a bit about SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services, a powerful tool that allows enterprise reporting. Reporting Services enables you to develop and serve reports across your organization and even to business partners outside your company. Reporting Services also gives end users the ability to create their own reports, helping them transform business data into valuable, usable information to guide their day–to–day decisions.<br/> About the Author<br/><br/> Robin Dewson has been hooked on programming ever since he bought his first computer, a Sinclair ZX80, in 1980. He has been working with SQL Server since version 6.5 and Visual Basic since version 5. Robin is a consultant mainly in the city of London, where he has been for nearly eight years. He also has been developing a rugby–related website as well as maintaining his own site at www.fat-belly.com.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://megashare.vn/dl.php/570396</span></span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i.pdfchm.net/8/c/11838/200/object-oriented-javascript.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/> Object-Oriented JavaScript, 9781847194145 (1847194141), Packt Publishing, 2008<br/> Once listed in the "nice to have" sections of job postings, these days the knowledge of JavaScript is a deciding factor when it comes to hiring web developers. And rightly so. Where in the past we used to have the occasional few lines of JavaScript embedded in a web page, now we have advanced libraries and extensible architectures, powering the "fat-client", AJAX-type rich internet applications.<br/><br/> JavaScript is the language of the browser, but it's also heavily employed in many other environments: server-side programming, desktop applications, application extensions and widgets. It's a pretty good deal: you learn one language and then code all kinds of different applications. While this book has one chapter specifically dedicated to the web browser environment including DOM, events, and AJAX tutorials, the rest is applicable to all the other environments too.<br/><br/> This book treats JavaScript as a serious object-oriented language, showing you how to build robust, maintainable, and powerful libraries and applications. Along the way, we cover many of the recent innovations such as AJAX, JSON, and interesting design and coding patterns. After reading this book, you'll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe didn't know. You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication.<br/><br/> What you will learn from this book?<br/><br/> * Learn to think in JavaScript, the language of the web browser<br/> * The basics of object-oriented programming, and how they apply to JavaScript<br/> * Set up and use your training environment (Firebug)<br/> * Master data types, operators, and flow control statements<br/> * Understand functions: usage patterns, variable scope, and built-in functions<br/> * Closures demystified<br/> * Create and use objects<br/> * Understand and use prototypes<br/> * Reuse code with common patterns for inheritance<br/> * Understand and work with the BOM (Browser Object Model)<br/> * The DOM (Document Object Model) - accessing, modifying, adding, and deleting nodes<br/> * Build responsive web pages with AJAX<br/> * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)<br/> * Listen and respond to browser events<br/> * Apply design patterns to solve common problems<br/> * Adopt coding patterns that unleash the unique power of the language<br/> * Make your programs cleaner, faster, and compatible with other programs and libraries<br/> * Achieve missing object-oriented features in JavaScript such as private properties and methods<br/><br/> Who is this book written for?<br/><br/> The book requires no prior knowledge of JavaScript and works from the ground up to give you a thorough grounding in this powerful language. If you do already know some JavaScript, you will find plenty of eye-openers as you discover just what the language can do.<br/><br/> This book takes a do-it-yourself approach when it comes to writing code, because the best way to really learn a programming language is by writing code. You are encouraged to type code into Firebug's console, see how it works and then tweak it and play around with it. There are practice questions at the end of each chapter to help review what you have learned.<br/><br/> About the Author<br/><br/> Stoyan Stefanov is a Yahoo! web developer, Zend Certified Engineer, book author, and contributor to the international PHP community.Stoyan is the engineering lead of Yahoo's performance optimization tool 'YSlow', as well as other open-source tools and 'PEAR' libraries.<br/><br/> link download<br/><span class="link"> http://megashare.vn/dl.php/570385</span></span>
