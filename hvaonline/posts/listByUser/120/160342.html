			<span class="postbody"><b>Bluetooth Application Programming with the Java APIs, Essentials Edition (Paperback)</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i25.tinypic.com/2d29af7.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Adoption of Bluetooth wireless technology has become ubiquitous in the<br/> last few years. One of the biggest steps forward is the standardization<br/> of Java APIs for Bluetooth wireless technology (JABWT). The latest<br/> updates to this standard is explained in detail in this book. The JABWT<br/> standard, defined by the JSR-82 Java Specification Request, supports<br/> rapid development of Bluetooth applications that are portable, secure,<br/> and highly-usable. Wireless device manufacturers have responded<br/> overwhelmingly to the JABWT specification by implementing JABWT<br/> applications in mobile phones and other personal wireless communications<br/> products.<br/><br/> "Bluetooth Application Programming Essentials: Programming with the Java<br/> APIs" explains in detail how to write Bluetooth applications using the<br/> Java APIs to exploit the power of both technologies. Written by the<br/> specification lead for JSR-82 and two other key participants in<br/> developing the standards of JABWT, this book provides the authoritative<br/> explanations and concrete examples needed to get started right away.<br/> This book provides embedded Java developers with to-the-point<br/> information on the APIs in the specification with detailed programmatic<br/> examples of the APIs in use. A NEW chapter on the Push Registry<br/> definition (a new feature in the 1.1 version of JSR-82) has been added.<br/> Finally, the new Essentials version of the book will update the<br/> remaining chapters to reflect changes in the latest Bluetooth spec (2.1)<br/> and the industry as a whole. As a bonus, this edition of the book offers<br/> over 200 pages of added content on the website. This "bonus material"<br/> includes complete source code from examples in the book, the<br/> javex.bluetooth code package, the java.obex code package, an enhanced<br/> set of "Example Applications", and a tutorial on "Implementing JABWT on<br/> a Device." These code-heavy sections are actually more effective in<br/> electonic format where the application can be easily downloaded. KEY<br/> FEATURES & BENEFITS<br/><br/> * By focusing only on the essentials, this concise resource enables<br/> software and hardware vendors to quickly develop Bluetooth applications<br/> for mobile devices in an increasingly competitive market.<br/><br/> * The updated material examines crucial programming areas (including<br/> RFCOMM, OBEX, device discovery, service discovery, and L2CAP), which<br/> allows developers to not only successfully design, but master and build<br/> Java APIs for Bluetooth Wireless Technology.<br/><br/> * Includes a new and valuable chapter that delineates the pivotal Push<br/> Registry feature ? a recent development that will help programmers avoid<br/> the common problem of connection collision.<br/><br/> * By providing real-world issues and problems involved in implementing<br/> the Java APIs specification, the book allows developers to identify with<br/> the text and encourages repeated reference.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i32.tinypic.com/2a0022w.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> In this book, authors Rich Shupe and Zevan Rosser share the knowledge<br/> they've gained from their years as multimedia developers/designers and<br/> teachers. Learning ActionScript 3.0 gives you a solid foundation in the<br/> language of Flash and demonstrates how you can use it for practical,<br/> everyday projects. The authors do more than just give you a collection<br/> of sample scripts. Written for those of you new to ActionScript 3.0, the<br/> book describes how ActionScript and Flash work, giving you a clear look<br/> into essential topics such as logic, event handling, displaying content,<br/> migrating legacy projects to ActionScript 3.0, classes, and much more.<br/> You will learn important techniques through hands-on exercises, and then<br/> build on those skills as chapters progress. ActionScript 3.0 represents<br/> a significant change for many Flash users, and a steeper learning curve<br/> for the uninitiated. This book will help guide you through a variety of<br/> scripting scenarios. Rather than relying heavily on prior knowledge of<br/> object-oriented programming (OOP), topics are explained in focused<br/> examples that originate in the timeline, with optional companion classes<br/> for those already comfortable with their use. As chapters progress, the<br/> book introduces more and more OOP techniques, allowing you to choose<br/> which scripting approach you prefer. Learning ActionScript 3.0 reveals:<br/> New ways to harness the power and performance of AS3 Common mistakes<br/> that people make with the language Essential coverage of text, sound,<br/> video, XML, drawing with code, and more Migration issues from AS1 and<br/> AS2 to AS3 Simultaneous development of procedural and object-oriented<br/> techniques Tips that go beyond simple script collections, including how<br/> toapproach a project and which resources can help you along the way The<br/> companion web site contains material for all the exercises in the book,<br/> as well as short quizzes to make sure you're up to speed with key<br/> concepts. ActionScript 3.0 is a different animal from previous versions,<br/> and Learning ActionScript 3.0 teaches everything that web designers,<br/> GUI-based Flash developers, and those new to ActionScript need to start<br/> using the language.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i28.tinypic.com/wrytci.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> This book is an upgrade from the previous version that covered phpMyAdmin Version<br/> 2.8. Version 2.10 introduced a new GUI for relations, called Designer, and version<br/> 2.11 adds support for creating Views from query results, manages triggers,<br/> procedures and functions and has an improved interface for servers handling large<br/> number of databases/tables.<br/><br/> In Detail:<br/><br/> PhpMyAdmin is a well known and popular open-source tool written in PHP intended to<br/> handle the administration of MySQL over the Internet. Currently it can create and<br/> drop databases, create/drop/alter tables, delete/edit/add fields, execute any SQL<br/> statement, and manage keys on fields. While most MySQL developers use routine<br/> features of phpMyAdmin every day, few are aware of the power and potential of its<br/> advanced features. This book builds a solid understanding of the core capabilities<br/> of phpMyAdmin before walking you through every facet of this legendary tool.<br/><br/> MySQL is the most popular open-source database, used by millions of developers and<br/> supporting numerous large dynamic websites and applications. MySQL acquired this<br/> wide popularity by virtue of its open-source nature, performance, reliability,<br/> robustness, and support for various platforms. This popularity has also been helped<br/> by the existence of phpMyAdmin, the industry-standard administration tool that makes<br/> database management easy for both the experienced developer and the novice.<br/><br/> The powerful graphical interface that it provides to MySQL has made phpMyAdmin an<br/> indispensable tool for MySQL and web developers. Every phpMyAdmin user can benefit<br/> from unlocking the full potential of this powerful application. Whether you are an<br/> experienced developer, system administrator, web designer, or new to MySQL and<br/> phpMyAdmin, this book will show you how to increase your productivity and control<br/> when working with your databases.<br/><br/> What you will learn from this book:<br/><br/> * Common reasons for installing PhpMyAdmin<br/> * Managing multiple servers on single copy of PhpMyAdmin<br/> * Securing your PhpMyAdmin installation<br/> * Upgrading your PhpMyAdmin installation<br/> * Managing databases, data table structures, and indexes to create efficient databases<br/> * Administering MySQL users and privileges<br/> * Getting server and database statistics<br/> * Generating better documentation of evolving table structures<br/><br/> Along the way you will build a more detailed understanding of SQL and how it works in MySQL.<br/><br/> Approach:<br/><br/> This book is a tutorial that systematically explains and demonstrates the potential of this<br/> tool. It then goes on to show the less well known and generally under-used features and<br/> capabilities of phpMyAdmin in depth.<br/><br/> Who this book is written for?<br/><br/> Whether you are an experienced developer, system administrator, web designer or new to MySQL,<br/> phpMyAdmin is a must-have tool for anyone who needs to manage MySQL databases and tables.<br/> This book is a must-read for every serious phpMyAdmin user who would like to use this<br/> outstanding application to its full power.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i27.tinypic.com/oppa91.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> The process of disaster recovery involves mitigating the likelihood of a<br/> disaster and returning the system to a normal state. This book shows you<br/> how to implement an effective disaster recovery strategy for SQL Server<br/> 2005 databases. With the arrival of SQL Server 2005, you have access to<br/> enhanced existing features and powerful new tools, like database<br/> snapshots and mirroring, for data backup and disaster recovery. The book<br/> also covers fundamental changes to disaster recovery capabilities, and<br/> common issues to expect when using new features. The book examines the<br/> technical details of disaster recovery features, and then applies that<br/> information to practical scenarios. As businesses become increasingly<br/> reliant on the information they store in their various databases,<br/> effective data protection becomes ever more critical. Potential<br/> disasters can arise from natural causes, user errors, and media or<br/> hardware failure. This book will help you ensure that day–to–day<br/> activities can continue, regardless of the problem.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i26.tinypic.com/2cohnc1.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> If you're a web developer with previous JavaScript and DOM scripting<br/> experience, Accelerated DOM Scripting with Ajax, APIs, and Libraries is<br/> perfect for you to take your knowledge up to the next level. This book<br/> is about JavaScript and using the document object model-the conduit to<br/> the HTML document. This book is not about learning how to program<br/> JavaScript from scratch. It starts with the assumption that you have<br/> done some JavaScript development before and understand the JavaScript<br/> syntax. This book builds on top of that knowledge to give you a deeper<br/> understanding of DOM Scripting and how to apply that to your projects.<br/> It uses this new understanding to describe what JavaScript libraries are<br/> and show you how they can be applied to your project. The book will also<br/> explain Ajax and how best to plan and apply it to your projects. It<br/> explains how to build simple animation objects for adding movement to<br/> elements on the page. There are straightforward examples that<br/> demonstrate the techniques used throughout the book. JavaScript has seen<br/> a resurgence in popularity over the past few years, and with it has come<br/> an exploration of the power of the language as well as what it can do<br/> within the browser. This book will explain techniques new and old-such<br/> as closures, encapsulation, and inheritance-that many are using and how<br/> you can best apply them to your own projects. By reading this book, you<br/> should have a greater understanding of how JavaScript works and be able<br/> to use advanced concepts such as closures and event delegation to build<br/> more flexible applications for the Web. You'll walk away with a greater<br/> appreciation for JavaScript libraries and how they can simplify and<br/> speed up your development. You'll also be able to implement Ajax<br/> effectively into your site, create special effects, use JavaScript<br/> libraries, and know how best to apply these libraries to your projects.<br/><br/> What you'll learn:<br/><br/> - Where CSS, HTML, and the DOM fit into modern scripting, and how to<br/> use them together effectively<br/> - OOP techniques for more efficient JavaScript coding<br/> - How to use JavaScript libraries such as Prototype in your work<br/> - How to build effective form validation into your applications using Ajax<br/> - How to create mashups using APIs<br/> - How to build dynamic user interfaces<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

			<span class="postbody"><b>Pro Windows PowerShell (Pro) (Paperback)</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i31.tinypic.com/eimmtw.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Windows power users have always envied their friends running UNIX<br/> machines for the ease of automation that they enjoy. The traditional<br/> Windows command-line shell, cmd.exe, has never been up to par with<br/> shells like bash or tcsh, especially when it comes to text processing<br/> and process automation. Windows PowerShell changes all that. This<br/> next-generation shell is also a full-blown scripting environment with a<br/> real programming language that allows users to access every part of<br/> their operating system. Files, registry entries, and COM and .NET<br/> objects are all supported by PowerShell, which makes manipulating them a<br/> breeze.<br/><br/> Pro Windows PowerShell will show you how to use all this power in your<br/> own work. You'll discover the object-oriented features of the shell and<br/> how they help in extracting and manipulating data. You'll then learn how<br/> to use those features to solve real-world problems: manipulating files,<br/> working with text, monitoring systems, and performing operations over<br/> the network. The book serves as not only a tutorial, but also a<br/> reference: the “Real World” part is structured so that it can be read<br/> nonlinearly and used as a reference or a cookbook. And you'll find<br/> freely available tools and extensions that will help you do things even<br/> faster.<br/><br/> Pro Windows PowerShell is your best companion to the capabilities and<br/> power that PowerShell offers you.<br/><br/> What you'll learn:<br/><br/> - See how to solve real problems with Windows PowerShell using a<br/> repository of working code.<br/> - Get a sense of “the big picture,” with PowerShell integrating with<br/> the outside world. You will discover examples and techniques when<br/> dealing with other programs, the operating system, and the network.<br/> - Explore free and open-source tools and extensions that help you get<br/> results with Windows PowerShell fast. (No other book has this feature!)<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/><br/> Pro Windows PowerShell is targeted at professionals who handle a lot of<br/> repetitive tasks. The goal is to show how PowerShell can help script<br/> most of those tasks and reduce their burden. The book contains examples<br/> on automating typical system administration tasks: configuration,<br/> monitoring, network queries, text manipulation, and file operations. The<br/> ideas presented will be beneficial to power users needing a better shell<br/> and an automation environment, system and network administrators looking<br/> to streamline their daily activities, and software developers wishing to<br/> optimize their build and deploy process.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i25.tinypic.com/2rfpi86.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> This book offers a simple to read, fast way to discover all that's new<br/> in Mac OS X Leopard, and how to make the most of it, whether you are new<br/> to the Mac, or simply upgrading from a previous version of Mac OS X. New<br/> additions to the operating system are showcased, including the changes<br/> to the Dock and Finder, and new features such as Stacks, Cover Flow, and<br/> Quick View introduced, before the book moves on to give a basic guide to<br/> using the Mac-creating folders, moving files, installing applications,<br/> and burning CDs, for example. Communication and organization are covered<br/> with chapters on Mail and iChat, including information on how to get the<br/> most of the latest features such as creating to-do items, and reading<br/> RSS feeds in Mail, and sharing screens in iChat. There are chapters that<br/> cover Spaces and Time Machine, perhaps the most talked about feature in<br/> this release of Mac OS X. iLife is fully dealt with, with discrete<br/> chapters on iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD, and GarageBand, followed<br/> with a chapter on iWeb showing how to share your creations, and using<br/> Front Row to be entertained by them. The final chapters of the book give<br/> an overview of some more advanced areas of using a Mac, namely how Mac<br/> OS X itself works, and also how to develop for the Mac. These chapters<br/> are intended only to give a glimpse as to the possibilities-the book is<br/> primarily aimed at regular users. A number of appendices conclude the<br/> book, one providing a guide to those users who are switching from<br/> Windows, and another that contains a useful list of recommended Mac<br/> applications for a wide array of uses. In the authors own words "This<br/> book isn't a bible or tome about how to do anything and everything with<br/> Mac OS X, instead its goal is to introduce the major features of Mac OS<br/> X so you can be up and running quickly".<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

One of those libraries has<br/> risen near the top in the Java space, and that library is DWR. DWR, or Direct Web<br/> Remoting, allows you to treat your Java classes running on the server as if they<br/> were local objects running in the browser, bringing the full power of your server<br/> –side business logic to the client without the usual problems that entails.<br/> In this book:<br/><br/> * You’ll explore DWR and all it offers.<br/> * You’ll find six full, working applications<br/> that use DWR, instead of a lot of theoretical musings.<br/> * You’ll learn by example, more importantly, by doing,<br/> as you tear the applications apart, see what makes<br/> them tick, and even extend them at your own pace.<br/><br/> In the end, you’ll have a great feel for what DWR offers and how Ajax can bring the<br/> world of Web 2.0 to your doorstep, and you’ll have a good time doing it.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn:<br/><br/> * Call a server–side object in a snap and make it look like any<br/> local JavaScript call to boot.<br/> * Provide a strong security mechanism for securing your server-side code.<br/> * Integrate with many of the most popular frameworks out there.<br/> * Provide not only Ajax but Comet capabilities (sometimes called reverse Ajax).<br/> * Dig into Ajax using DWR in a practical and hacking kind of way starting<br/> with a webmail client and Wiki projects.<br/> * Build a simple file manager application and an online timesheet system.<br/> * Complete a DWR–based game project.<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/><br/> Web application developers, senior projects leads, and application architects<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>
