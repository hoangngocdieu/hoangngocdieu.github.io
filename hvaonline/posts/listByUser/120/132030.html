<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/7592/66666396np1.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Product Description<br/> Networking For Dummies has long been the leading networking beginner book. The 7th Edition provides valuable updates on the latest tools and trends in networking, including updates to Windows XP (through Service Pack 2), Windows Server 2003, Linux, Mac OS X, and Novell Netware Server 6.5 plus the latest information on broadband technologies. A must-have reference for network administrators and novices who want to set up a network in their home or office, this covers all the bases and basics, including:<br/><br/> * Using a network printer and sharing files and printers<br/> * Using Microsoft Office on a network<br/> * Network operating systems<br/> * Setting up a wireless network<br/> * Configuring client computers<br/><br/> Written by Doug Lowe, a seasoned For Dummies author who has demystified everything from Microsoft Office to networking to creating Web pages and written more than 50 computer books, including Networking All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, this guide includes whole new chapters on:<br/><br/> * Wireless networking<br/> * IP addressing<br/> * Common security problems<br/> * Troubleshooting<br/><br/> Indexed to help you find answers fast and written in plain English instead of technotalk, this keeps you from getting all shook up while youre getting all hooked up!<br/><br/> About the Author<br/> Doug Lowe has written a whole bunch of computer books, including more than 35 For Dummies books (such as PowerPoint 2003 For Dummies, Word 2003 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies, Networking All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies, and Internet Explorer 6 For Dummies). He lives in that sunny All-American City of Fresno, California, which isn’t nearly as close to San Francisco as most people think, with his wife and two of his daughters (the other one’s away at college). He’s one of those obsessive-compulsive decorating nuts who puts up tens of thousands of lights at Christmas and creates computer-controlled Halloween decorations that rival Disney’s Haunted Mansion. Maybe his next book should be Tacky Holiday Decorations For Dummies.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/131555493/Netw0rking_For_Dumm_es__7th_Ed_tion_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/6439/69363589za0.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Book description<br/> Network Troubleshooting Tools helps you sort through the thousands of tools that have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks and choose the ones that are best for your needs. It also shows you how to approach network troubleshooting using these tools, how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise so you can solve them more effectively.<br/><br/> Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There’s only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them? Network Troubleshooting Tools does the work for you–by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of ping that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There’s tkined for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems. This book isn’t just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively. The topics covered in this book include:<br/><br/> * Understanding your network<br/> * Connectivity testing<br/> * Evaluating the path between two network nodes<br/> * Tools for capturing packets<br/> * Tools for network discovery and mapping<br/> * Tools for working with SNMP<br/> * Performance monitoring<br/> * Testing application layer protocols<br/> * Software sources<br/><br/> If you’re involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/131554382/Netw0rk_Tr0ubl3shoot_ng_T00ls_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/3572/31934960jk7.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Product Description<br/> Network Calculus is a set of recent developments that provide deep insights into flow problems encountered in the Internet and in intranets. The first part of the book is a self-contained, introductory course on network calculus. It presents the core of network calculus, and shows how it can be applied to the Internet to obtain results that have physical interpretations of practical importance to network engineers. The second part serves as a mathematical reference used across the book. It presents the results from Min-plus algebra needed for network calculus. The third part contains more advanced material. It is appropriate reading for a graduate course and a source of reference for professionals in networking by surveying the state of the art of research and pointing to open problems in network calculus and its application in different fields, such as mulitmedia smoothing, aggegate scheduling, adaptive guarantees in Internet differential services, renegotiated reserved services, etc.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/131553903/Netw0rk_C_lculus_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/><br/> </span>

The cost, stability and ease of development using the Open Source PHP 4 scripting language and a MySQL database makes this combination the best choice for small and mid-size Web-based applications. PHP4/MySQL Database Applications demonstrates web-application development by presenting seven real, ready-to-use examples starting with a simple guess book and ending with a fully-functional e-commerce site with a shopping cart. Inexperienced users will learn the essentials of working with PHP4 and MySQL so they can start building and customizing database applications for the web right away!<br/><br/> From the Back Cover<br/> MySQL/PHP Database Applications Affordable Open Source Solutions to E-Commerce Challenges In this unique guide, two Web development gurus show you how to harness the open source power of MySQL and PHP — and create high-performance Web database applications that won’t break the bank.

Nhưng nếu lấy con khác cùng hộp hàng đó mà lắp trên Port IP DSLAM đó thì lại chạy đựoc, trong một thùng có con chạy đựoc, con không chạy đựoc (các thông số về account hay port đều không hề thay đổi).

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/6011/22092354tq0.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> As a major force in the world of affordable, advanced web site deployment, Joomla! has become the most important noncommercial Content Management System (CMS) in the world. The number of Joomla! downloads and add-ons continues to grow at lightning pace, spurring the need for a resource that explores the diverse needs of professional Joomla! developers. This book fills that void by covering the two main areas of the Joomla! field–development and deployment–with a focus on the new Joomla! version 1.5 and all the features it provides.<br/><br/> Seasoned author Dan Rahmel walks you through the process of creating all three types of Joomla! extensions (modules, components, and plug-ins), explains how best to use Ajax technology, and shows you how to adopt design patterns and incorporate source code control. You’ll examine the underlying technologies (PHP, Apache, etc.) that can be tuned to offer the best system performance, and you’ll explore interfacing with outside content, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) setup, and much more. You’ll even delve into the internal structure of the Joomla! framework, and obtain a unique behind-the-scenes education so that you can modify and extend Joomla! to meet the needs of you and your customers.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/132087574/Professional_Joomla_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img77.imageshack.us/img77/9049/73871510lm8.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Product Description<br/> With in-depth complete coverage on the installation process, editing and typesetting, graphical user interfaces, programming system administration, and managing Internet sites, Inside Linux is the only book “smart users” new to Linux will need. Many of the users new to Linux have an understanding of computer technology and will be looking for just the right reference to fit their sophisticated needs. This book guides users to a high level of proficiency with all the flavors of Linux, and help them with crucial system administration chores. Inside Linux is different than other books available because it’s a unique blend of a how-to and a reference guide.<br/><br/> Amazon.com<br/> The author of Inside Linux acknowledges that adequately teaching how to use Linux involves more than communicating a series of recipes. For that reason, he goes to considerable effort to explain what’s going on when the user executes various commands. He uses procedures to expose facts about Linux’s innards, rather than as mere strategies for achieving desired effects. Therefore, his prose–particularly his extended coverage of the bash shell–reads like a scientist’s journal: If we do this, here’s what happens (and by the way, here’s why). The approach is more leisurely than that of many introductory Linux books, and it leads to a deeper understanding of what’s going on under the shell.<br/><br/> The author shows how to configure and use XFree86, the K Desktop Environment (KDE), and GNOME. These are handy skills to have, even if most distributions will more or less automate those processes and some readers may wish instead for information on more obscure aspects of the operating system. Coverage of network configuration, where an intimate knowledge of the command line and configuration files is critical, suits this book’s experiment-and-observe format very well. The reader gets to see lots of important pieces of software in action. There’s nothing about Apache, but the sections on setting up FTP and Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP) services are particularly detailed. –David Wall<br/><br/> Topics covered: Linux for those unfamiliar with the operating system, with particular focus on the Caldera OpenLinux 2.2, Red Hat Linux 6, Slackware Linux 4, and SuSE Linux 6.1 distributions. Installation of XFree86, KDE, and GNOME are covered, as are the mechanics of setting up a TCP/IP network at the command line. Coverage of FTP and UUCP services conclude this book.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/131527669/Ins_de_L_nux_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/1278/22253349bc6.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses version 5.2.3790.1830 of core files, the same version used by Windows XP 64-bit Edition 2003 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 as they were the latest versions during the operating system’s development. It is designed to use the expanded 64-bit memory address space provided by the x86-64 architecture.<br/><br/> The primary benefit of moving to 64-bit is the increase in the maximum allocatable system memory (RAM). Windows XP 32-bit is limited to a total of 4 GB, which is, by default, equally divided between Kernel and application usage. Using the /3GB switch in the boot.ini file forces Windows to limit the kernel to the upper 1GB and provides up to 3GB for applications. Windows XP x64 can support much more memory; although the theoretical memory limit a 64-bit computer can address is about 16 exbibytes (16 billion Gibabytes), Windows XP x64 is currently limited to 128 GB of physical memory and 16 TiB of virtual memory. Microsoft claims this limit will be increased as hardware capabilities improve.<br/><br/> Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is not to be confused with Windows XP 64-bit Edition, as the latter was designed for Intel Itanium processors, although they both are commonly referred to as ‘64-bit Windows’ by Microsoft due to their similarities from developer’s point of view.<br/><br/> Both Windows 2003 x64 and XP x64 use identical kernels and codebase. This is evident when the System Information tool reports the current OS as Windows Server 2003 x64 and not Windows XP.<br/><br/> Compatibility with 32-bit applications<br/><br/> Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses a technology named Windows-on-Windows 64-bit (WOW64), which permits the execution of 32-bit x86 applications. It was first employed in Windows XP 64-bit Edition (for the Itanium), but then reused for the “x64 Editions” of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.<br/><br/> Since the X86-64 architecture includes hardware-level support for 32-bit instructions, WOW64 simply switches the process between 32- and 64-bit modes. As a result, X86-64 architecture microprocessors suffer no performance loss when executing 32-bit Windows applications. On the Itanium architecture, WOW64 was required to translate 32-bit x86 instructions into their 64-bit Itanium equivalents—which in some cases were implemented in quite different ways—so that the processor could execute them. All 32-bit processes are shown with *32 in the task manager, while 64-bit processes have no extra text present.<br/><br/> Although 32-bit applications can be run transparently, the mixing of the two types of code within the same process is not allowed. A 64-bit application cannot link against a 32-bit library (DLL) and similarly a 32-bit application cannot link against a 64-bit library. This may lead to the need for library developers to provide both 32- and 64-bit binary versions of their libraries. Windows XP x64 Edition includes both 32- and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer 6, in order to allow for the possibility that some third-party browser plugins or ActiveX controls may not yet be available in 64-bit versions.<br/><br/> Older 32-bit drivers and services are not supported by 64-bit Windows, but video and audio codecs such as XviD or OggDS (which are in fact 32-bit DLLs), are supported as long as the media player that uses them is 32-bit as well.<br/><br/> No Act!v@t!on - Original MSDN ISO<br/><br/> md5: 33a35e7544201ea47fee6cac6a52153b<br/><br/> Download:<br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/130862587/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part1.rar</span><br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/131683348/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part2.rar</span><br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/130925021/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part3.rar</span><br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/130936782/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part4.rar</span><br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/130944664/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part5.rar</span><br/> <span class="link"> http://anonymz.com/?http://rapidshare.com/files/130949771/W_n.XP.Pr0.x64.Ed.SP2.Rilwis.tk.part6.rar</span><br/><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/8155/10737741cs8.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> USB Disk Security provides 100% protection against any threats via USB drive, however, the majority of other products are unable even to guarantee 90% protection. USB Disk Security is the best antivirus software to permanently protect offline computer without the need for signature updates, but other antivirus software should update signature database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computer. This light and easy to use solution is 100% compatible with all software and doesn’t slow down your computer at all. You pay USB Disk Security once and get it all, however, other antivirus products should be paid for updates every year.<br/><br/> Product Highlights:<br/><br/> - 100% protection against any malicious programs via USB storage<br/><br/> USB Disk Security uses innovative proactive technology to block any threats via USB drive. There are relatively few products available in shops or on the Internet which offer even close to 100% protection against any malicious programs via USB drive. The majority of products are unable even to guarantee 90% protection. USB Disk Security is the world’s best software to block threats via USB drive.<br/><br/> - The best solution to protect offline computer<br/><br/> Other antivirus software should update signature database regularly, and they cannot effectively protect offline computer that is not connected to the Internet. When new viruses, worms and other malicious attacks strike, traditional signatures are insufficient. Every minute one waits for a virus signature update creates a window of vulnerability that could have devastating consequences. USB Disk Security uses advanced proactive detection techniques, requires no signature updates, and closes the window of vulnerability left open by other reactive, signature-based responses.<br/><br/> - The world’s fastest and smallest antivirus software<br/><br/> With USB Disk Security, it’s not necessary to sacrifice speed for detection and scanning. Compare antivirus software and you’ll discover that USB Disk Security is by far one of the smallest applications in the industry. For example, the v5.0 of USB Disk Security installer is just 1 MB. The program utilizes approximately 1 to 7 MB of RAM.<br/><br/> - 100% compatible with all software<br/><br/> Incompatibility between antivirus programs is an issue. In the vast majority of cases, installing two antivirus programs from different vendors on one machine (for increased protection) is technically impossible, as the two programs will disrupt each other’s functioning. However, USB Disk Security is 100% compatible with all software, including Windows Vista.<br/><br/> - Simple to use<br/><br/> USB Disk Security has been specifically designed to perform effectively regardless of the user’s level of computer expertise. Just install and forget it.<br/><br/> - System Requirement<br/><br/> 100MHz Processor or more, 16MB RAM or more.

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/5449/38995753is6.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Book Info<br/> Designed to help you maximize system integrity and availability on any Unix system-including clusters, monitor systems, disks, networks applications, and databases, with tips for recovery and prevention. Provides quick reference diagnostics and recovery section for systems operators. Softcover. DLC: UNIX (Computer file).<br/><br/> From the Inside Flap<br/> Preface<br/><br/> This book is intended for system administrators and operators who are responsible for maintaining the integrity and availability of mission-critical UNIX systems. The book provides a description of the fault monitoring tools and techniques available for UNIX servers, including systems that are configured as high availability clusters.<br/><br/> This book can therefore be a handy quick reference for an operator trying to troubleshoot a problem in the customer environment, by pointing out where to find key diagnostic messages and describing how to take recovery actions.<br/><br/> A system administrator responsible for the initial configuration and administration of UNIX systems will also find this book useful because it describes the procedures to follow to set up the appropriate levels of system monitoring. The product descriptions can also help in making purchasing decisions as the customer determines the appropriate amount of event monitoring needed in their environment.<br/><br/> An overview of the tasks performed by an operator is provided, with details on how events are received and processed. The remainder of the book focuses on the types of events that can be received, how they are detected, how operators receive event notifications, and how problems can be investigated and recovery performed. The goal is to introduce the necessary tools, but not to show how every possible problem can be solved.<br/><br/> This book provides numerous descriptions of how fault management tools and products can be used to solve a variety of problems. Many of the chapters are focused on specific computer components, such as disks or databases, to be helpful to operators with specific roles. Here is a description of the individual chapters:<br/><br/> Chapter 1, “Analyzing the Role of System Operators,” describes the tasks performed by a system operator and the evolution of fault management.<br/> Chapter 2, “Enumerating Possible Events,” describes the various types of events that are interesting to monitor on a UNIX system.<br/> Chapter 3, “Using Monitoring Frameworks,” describes monitoring frameworks and the administrative tasks that must be done before they can be used.<br/> Chapter 4, “Monitoring the System,” describes the tools and products used to monitor the UNIX server.<br/> Chapter 5, “Monitoring the Disks,” describes the tools and products used to monitor external disk devices.<br/> Chapter 6, “Monitoring the Network,” provides an overview of the many tools available for detecting problems and events related to the use of the network.<br/> Chapter 7, “Monitoring the Application,” describes methods for monitoring the response times and availability of critical applications.<br/> Chapter 8, “Monitoring the Database,” focuses specifically on tools to detect problems and events related to database usage.<br/> Chapter 9, “Enterprise Management,” discusses the problems with trying to deal with fault management for the large-scale customer enterprise.<br/> Chapter 10, “UNIX Futures,” discusses the future plans of some of the major UNIX system vendors in the area of fault management.<br/> Appendix A, “Standards,” describes fault management standards that have emerged and how you can benefit from them.<br/><br/> The Glossary contains the important terms used in the book, and their definitions.<br/> Although it is assumed that most customers concerned about fault management will implement high availability solutions, this book does not describe how to create highly available computing environments. Readers needing additional information on high availability may check Hewlett-PackardÕs external Web site on high availability (hp/go/ha) or read Clusters for High Availability by Peter Weygant.<br/><br/> In general, this book does not discuss the configuration and installation of the hardware and software components of your UNIX system. You should rely on your vendorsÕ product manuals for this.<br/><br/> Many of the examples used in this book were created on HP-UX servers. Other UNIX platforms behave similarly, and we note when tools are supported only on certain UNIX platforms.<br/><br/> <span class="link"> http://rapidshare.com/files/130836598/UNIX_Fault_Management_Rilwis.tk.rar</span><br/><br/> </span>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img115.imageshack.us/img115/9758/50151957ti2.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Writing is my most time-consuming hobby and I have found that this book is a great introduction to the basic skills involved in writing. Whether you are a professional or a beginner, it’s helpful to have this guide to establish a basic foundation for writing effectively. It is also a great reference tool in case you happen to forget one of the basic techniques.<br/><br/> TITLE: The Oxford Essential Guide to Writing<br/> Author: Thomas S.
