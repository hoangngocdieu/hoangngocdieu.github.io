			<span class="postbody"><b>C# in Depth: What you need to master C# 2 and 3 (Paperback)</b><br/><br/> <br>
<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i28.tinypic.com/2hdcutt.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> C# in Depth is a completely new book designed to propel existing C#<br/> developers to a higher level of programming skill. One simple principle<br/> drives this book: explore a few things deeply rather than offer a<br/> shallow view of the whole C# landscape. If you often find yourself<br/> wanting just a little more at the end of a typical chapter, this is the<br/> book for you. Expert author Jon Skeet dives into the C# language,<br/> plumbing new C# 2 and 3 features and probing the core C# language<br/> concepts that drive them. This unique book puts the new features into<br/> context of how C# has evolved without a lengthy rehearsal of the full C#<br/> language. C# in Depth briefly examines the history of C# and the .NET<br/> framework and reviews a few often-misunderstood C# 1 concepts that are<br/> very important as the foundation for fully exploiting C# 2 and 3.<br/> Because the book addresses C# 1 with a light touch, existing C#<br/> developers don't need to pick through the book in order to find new<br/> material to enhance their skills. This book focuses on the C# 2 and 3<br/> versions of the language, but clearly explains where features are<br/> supported by changes in the runtime (CLR) or use new framework classes.<br/> Each feature gets a thorough explanation, along with a look on how you'd<br/> use it in real life applications. C# in Depth is both a vehicle for<br/> learning C# 2 and 3 and a reference work. Although the coverage is<br/> in-depth, the text is always accessible: You'll explore pitfalls that<br/> can trip you up, but you'll skip over gnarly details best left to the<br/> language specification. The overall effect is that readers become not<br/> just proficient in C# 2 and 3, but comfortable that they truly<br/> understand the language.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i29.tinypic.com/idel1v.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> This book focuses exclusively on the application of PowerPoint to the creation of<br/> online training programs. Better than Bullet Points, Creating Engaging e-Learning<br/> with PowerPoint fills that gap. By providing in-depth guidance, specific<br/> instructions, and helpful exercises, the book will enable training practitioners<br/> to create impactful learning interactions in PowerPoint. The author steps readers<br/> through the powerful features of this popular desktop application, covering<br/> everything from text to art, animation to interactivity. Provided that the reader<br/> owns a copy of PowerPoint, this book will immediately put free real-world tools<br/> into the hands of those who need it. The information is practical rather than<br/> theoretical and immediately applicable. Most importantly, this book will help make<br/> e-learning accessible to those who have previously been excluded from taking<br/> advantage of the opportunities e-learning can provide.<br/><br/> Jane Bozarth is the e-learning coordinator for the North Carolina Office of State<br/> Personnel's Human Resource Development Group and has been a training practitioner<br/> since 1989. She is a columnist for Training Magazine and has written for numerous<br/> publications including Creative Training Techniques Newsletter and the Journal of<br/> Educational Technology and Society.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

WPF blends application user interface, documents, and media<br/> content to provide richer control, design, and development of the visual<br/> aspects of Windows programs. Author Matthew MacDonald shows you how WPF<br/> really works. His no-nonsense, practical advice will get you building<br/> high-quality WPF applications quickly and easily. MacDonald will take<br/> you through a thorough investigation of the more advanced aspects of<br/> WPF, and its relation to other elements of the WinFX stack and the .NET<br/> Framework 3.5, to complete your understanding of WPF and VB 2008. WPF's<br/> functionality extends to support for Tablet PCs and other forms of input<br/> device, and provides a more modern imaging and printing pipeline,<br/> accessibility and UI automation infrastructure, data-driven UI and<br/> visualization, as well as the integration points for weaving the<br/> application experience into the Windows shell.<br/> What you'll learn:<br/><br/> - WPF basics: XAML, layout, control essentials, and data flow<br/> - WPF applications: Navigation, commands, localization, and deployment<br/> - Advanced controls: Custom controls, menus, toolbars, and trees<br/> - WPF documents: Text layout, printing, and document packaging<br/> - Graphics and multimedia: Drawing shapes, sound and video, animation,<br/> geometric transformations, and imaging<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i26.tinypic.com/dxjx20.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Tired of clawing your way through computer books that start at the<br/> beginning of recorded history just to find one tiny nugget of<br/> information you need? Tired of wrenching your back to pull that massive<br/> Windows tome off your bookshelf? Tired of wishing you could find a<br/> simple answer to what should be a simple problem? If you answered yes to<br/> any of these questions, then 100 Things You Need to Know about<br/> Microsoft(r) Windows Vista™ is just the book you’ve been looking for.<br/> Chock full of timesaving tips, heady solutions, and expert know-how,<br/> this book doesn’t break the bank nor does it require a Bowflex body to<br/> hoist it around. Inside you’ll find step-by-step help for the 100 things<br/> every Windows user needs to know when making the big switch between<br/> Windows XP and Vista. Even if you’re brand new to Windows (meaning Vista<br/> is your first-ever operating system), you’ll find the advice here<br/> indispensable. In this book, we assume, for instance, that you really<br/> don’t give a hoot about what TCP/IP is. We’re betting you just want to<br/> get your Internet connection up and running, and leave the techy muck to<br/> the propeller heads.<br/><br/> • Want all the cool new cutting-edge features and interface Windows<br/> Vista offers? Well, before you run out and buy the software, you need to<br/> ensure your system will support it! We walk you through, step-by-step,<br/> how to manually check if your PC and other hardware and software are<br/> supported for use with Windows Vista. We show you how to perform common<br/> upgrade tasks, if needed, before you install Vista. In addition, we<br/> provide tips and procedures on backing up your data.<br/> • Having to choose between five different versions (yes, Vista comes<br/> in FIVE flavors!) can be confusing! Don’t sweat it, though--we’ve got<br/> you covered. We show you how to decide which flavor of Vista is best<br/> suited to you! Then we walk you through installing and setting up Vista<br/> for the very first time.<br/> • Next we dig into the new Vista interface, which is quite a change<br/> from the old XP! Then we give you a tour of the many new and enhanced<br/> features. While you might fancy yourself a wicked-smart Windows user,<br/> don’t skip this section! We’re positive you’ll find things you didn’t<br/> know that will help you make Vista do thy bidding.<br/> • Don’t like the slick new Vista interface? (Macintosh, anyone?) We<br/> show you how to harness the power of Vista while keeping the look and<br/> feel of your XP. Who says change has to be painful?<br/> • After you have the basics nailed, we then show you some of the cool<br/> things you can do with Vista, from customizing its performance, to<br/> disabling annoying security controls, to connecting to a wireless<br/> network.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i32.tinypic.com/i5vqbl.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Is Windows giving you pause? Ready to make the leap to the Mac instead?<br/> There has never been a better time to switch from Windows to Mac, and<br/> this incomparable guide will help you make a smooth transition. New York<br/> Times columnist and Missing Manuals creator David Pogue gets you past<br/> three challenges: transferring your stuff, assembling Mac programs so<br/> you can do what you did with Windows, and learning your way around Mac<br/> OS X. Why is this such a good time to switch? Upgrading from one version<br/> of Windows to another used to be simple. But now there's Windows Vista,<br/> a veritable resource hog that forces you to relearn everything. Learning<br/> a Mac is not a piece of cake, but once you do, the rewards are<br/> oh-so-much better. No viruses, worms or spyware. No questionable<br/> firewalls, inefficient permissions, or other strange features. Just a<br/> beautiful machine with a thoroughly reliable system. And if you're still<br/> using Windows XP, we've got you covered, too. If you're ready to take on<br/> Mac OS X Leopard, the latest edition of this bestselling guide tells you<br/> everything you need to know: Transferring your stuff -- Moving photos,<br/> MP3s, and Microsoft Office documents is the easy part. This book gets<br/> you through the tricky things: extracting your email, address book,<br/> calendar, Web bookmarks, buddy list, desktop pictures, and MP3 files.<br/> Re-creating your software suite -- Big-name programs (Word, Photoshop,<br/> Firefox, Dreamweaver, and so on) are available in both Mac and Windows<br/> versions, but hundreds of other programs are available only for Windows.<br/> This guide identifies the Mac equivalents and explains how to move your<br/> data to them. Learning Leopard -- Once you've moved into the Mac, a<br/> final task awaits: Learning your way around. Fortunately, you're in good<br/> hands with the author of Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, the #1<br/> bestselling guide to the Macintosh. Moving from Windows to a Mac<br/> successfully and painlessly is the one thing Apple does not deliver.<br/> Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Leopard Edition is your ticket<br/> to a new computing experience.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i25.tinypic.com/4jorw8.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> The Mac has fully embraced OpenGL throughout its visual systems. In<br/> fact, Apple's highly efficient, modern OpenGL implementation makes Mac<br/> OS X one of today's best platforms for OpenGL development. OpenGL<br/> Programming on Mac OS X is the first comprehensive resource for every<br/> graphics programmer who wants to create, port, or optimize OpenGL<br/> applications for this high-volume platform. Leading OpenGL experts<br/> Robert Kuehne and J. D. Sullivan thoroughly explain the Mac's diverse<br/> OpenGL APIs, both old and new. They illuminate crucial OpenGL setup,<br/> configuration, and performance issues that are unique to the Mac<br/> platform. Next, they offer practical, start-to-finish guidance for<br/> integrating key Mac-native APIs with OpenGL, and leveraging the full<br/> power of the Mac platform in your graphics applications. Coverage<br/> includes:<br/><br/> - A thorough review of Mac hardware and software architectures and<br/> their performance implications<br/> - In-depth, expert guidance for accessing OpenGL from each of the<br/> Mac's core APIs: CGL, AGL, and Cocoa<br/> - Interoperating with other Mac APIs: incorporating video with<br/> QuickTime, performing image effects with Core Image, and processing<br/> CoreVideo data<br/> - Analyzing Mac OpenGL application performance, resolving bottlenecks,<br/> and leveraging optimizations only available on the Mac<br/> - Detecting, integrating, and using OpenGL extensions<br/> - An accompanying Web site<span class="link"> www.macopenglbook.com</span>) contains the book's<br/> example code, plus additional OpenGL-related resources. OpenGL<br/> Programming on Mac OS X will be valuable to Mac programmers seeking to<br/> leverage OpenGL's power, OpenGL developers porting their applications to<br/> the Mac platform, and cross-platform graphics developers who want to<br/> take advantage of the Mac platform's uniquely intuitive style and<br/> efficiency.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/7716/1590599381hk9.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> This book is for anyone who wants to write good Visual Basic 2008 code – even if you have never programmed before.<br/><br/> Writing good code can be a challenge, there are so many options, especially in a language like Visual Basic. If you want to really get the best from a programming language you need to know which features work best in which situations and understand their strengths and weaknesses. It is this understanding that makes the difference between coding and coding well.<br/><br/> Beginning VB 2008 has been written to teach you how to use the Visual Basic programming language to solve problems. From the earliest chapters, and from the first introductory concepts, you'll be looking at real-world programming challenges and learning how Visual Basic can be used to overcome them. As you progress through the book the problems become more involved and interesting while the solutions become correspondingly more complex and powerful as Visual Basic features interact to achieve the results that you want.<br/><br/> By the time you've finished reading this book and worked through the sample exercises, you'll be a confident and very competent Visual Basic programmer. You will still have many explorations of the .NET Framework API to look forward to in your future career, but you will have a firm foundation to build from and you will know exactly where to go to find the things that you need to progress confidently in your projects.<br/><br/> Christian Gross is dedicated to helping his readers understand every detail of Beginning VB 2008 and so you can contact him via SKYPE (christianhgross) if you have bought this book and have a question about something Christian discusses. If Christian is available when you contact him, he will even try to answer you right away!<br/> What you’ll learn<br/><br/> * Become skilled in the Visual Basic 2008 programming language.<br/> * Learn everything you need to begin building your own applications in a solid, well–considered way: this book will teach you .NET coding from the ground up.<br/> * Use the Visual Studio IDE to create, debug, and deploy your applications.<br/> * Understand the mysteries of database access and the many ways that it can be accomplished from VB.<br/> * Delve deeply into the huge range of supporting technologies that the .NET Framework offers: LINQ, ASP.NET AJAX, ADO.NET 3.0, WPF, WCF, and Windows Workflow are all introduced and explained in a straightforward and easy-to-follow way.<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/><br/> This book is for anyone who’s just starting out to learn about Visual Basic 2008. It doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of object–oriented programming, of the .NET Framework, or of coding in general. It simply assumes that you’re an intelligent person who wants to learn and starts the journey from there.<br/><br/> URL :<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

One of those libraries has<br/> risen near the top in the Java space, and that library is DWR. DWR, or Direct Web<br/> Remoting, allows you to treat your Java classes running on the server as if they<br/> were local objects running in the browser, bringing the full power of your server<br/> –side business logic to the client without the usual problems that entails.<br/> In this book:<br/><br/> * You’ll explore DWR and all it offers.<br/> * You’ll find six full, working applications<br/> that use DWR, instead of a lot of theoretical musings.<br/> * You’ll learn by example, more importantly, by doing,<br/> as you tear the applications apart, see what makes<br/> them tick, and even extend them at your own pace.<br/><br/> In the end, you’ll have a great feel for what DWR offers and how Ajax can bring the<br/> world of Web 2.0 to your doorstep, and you’ll have a good time doing it.<br/><br/> What you’ll learn:<br/><br/> * Call a server–side object in a snap and make it look like any<br/> local JavaScript call to boot.<br/> * Provide a strong security mechanism for securing your server-side code.<br/> * Integrate with many of the most popular frameworks out there.<br/> * Provide not only Ajax but Comet capabilities (sometimes called reverse Ajax).<br/> * Dig into Ajax using DWR in a practical and hacking kind of way starting<br/> with a webmail client and Wiki projects.<br/> * Build a simple file manager application and an online timesheet system.<br/> * Complete a DWR–based game project.<br/><br/> Who is this book for?<br/><br/> Web application developers, senior projects leads, and application architects<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i29.tinypic.com/2ly2yk1.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> The book concentrates on leveraging Java Business Integration (JBI) for addressing real world<br/> integration problems with examples. Business level integration in Java needs to address<br/> integrating multiple flavors of business components including POJO, EJB, Web Services, JMS,<br/> etc. The book will explain all the above scenarios, using open source Apache ServiceMix as the<br/> ESB framework.<br/><br/> In Detail:<br/><br/> The book first discusses the various integration approaches available and introduces Enterprise<br/> Service Bus (ESB), which is a new Architectural pattern which can facilitate integrating services.<br/> ESB provides different forms of mediation services including routing and transformation. Java<br/> Business Integration (JBI) provides a collaboration framework which provides standard interfaces<br/> for integration components and protocols to plug into, thus allowing the assembly of Service<br/> Oriented Integration (SOI) frameworks following the ESB pattern. JBI is based on JSR 208, which<br/> is an extension of Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Once JBI and ESB are introduced, we look at<br/> how we have been doing service integration without either of the above using traditional J2EE.<br/> The book then slowly introduces ESB and showcases with the help of code, how easily things can<br/> be done using JBI.<br/><br/> * Assemble services and port it across containers using JBI<br/> * Expose EJB as WSDL compliant service across firewalls<br/> * Bind remote services onto the ESB to be consumed internally<br/> * Expose local components in ESB like POJO as WSDL compliant services<br/> to be accessible externally.<br/> * Provide a web service gateway for external consumers<br/> * Access web services over reliable transport channel like JMS<br/> * Implement web service versioning using ESB<br/> * Implement service aggregation at ESB<br/> * Transactions, Security, Clustering & JMS in ESB.<br/><br/> Who this book is written for?<br/><br/> This book is aimed at Java developers and integration architects aiming to become proficient with<br/> Java Business Integration (JBI) standard, who are expected to have some experience with Java and<br/> to have developed and deployed applications in the past, but need no previous knowledge of JBI.<br/> The book can also be useful to anyone, who has been having a hard time understanding ESB and how<br/> it differs from other architectures and to understand its position in SOA.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

Once you know the basics of how the language<br/> works, wouldn't it be great to have a collection of useful scripts that<br/> solve those tricky problems and add interesting functionality to your<br/> site? We thought so, too. Instead of starting at "Hello World," Wicked<br/> Cool PHP assumes that you're familiar with the language and jumps right<br/> into the good stuff. After you learn the FAQs of life-the most commonly<br/> wished for PHP scripts-you'll work your way through smart configuration<br/> options and the art of forms, all the way through to complex<br/> database-backed scripts. Wicked Cool PHP contains a wide variety of<br/> scripts to process credit cards, check the validity of email addresses,<br/> template HTML, and serve dynamic images and text. The 76 easily<br/> implemented scripts will also teach you how to:<br/><br/> - Send and receive email notifications<br/> - Track your visitors' behavior with cookies and sessions<br/> - Override PHP's default settings<br/> - Manipulate dates, images, and text on the fly<br/> - Harness SOAP and other web services<br/> - Create an online poll, ecard delivery system, and blog But it's not<br/> all fun and games: Security is a big concern when programming any web<br/> application. So you'll learn how to encrypt your confidential data,<br/> safeguard your passwords, and prevent common cross-site-scripting<br/> attacks. And you'll learn how to customize all of the scripts to fit<br/> your own needs. Dynamic Web content doesn't have to be difficult.

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i32.tinypic.com/143m4k4.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Written by the instructors and creators of the JNTCP-ER Certification<br/> Exams, JUNOS Enterprise Routing is the only comprehensive book for<br/> Juniper enterprise and edge routing environments. It offers complete<br/> coverage of all the services available to the JUNOS administrator,<br/> including JUNOS Enhanced Services (ES). This book is the official<br/> study guide for all three Juniper Enterprise Routing certification<br/> exams, and is highly recommended reading to pass the exams. With its<br/> field-guide emphasis on practical solutions, you can easily take the<br/> book beyond the classroom and into working networks as a design,<br/> maintenance, and troubleshooting reference par excellence. JUNOS<br/> Enterprise Routing covers all three certification exams in this track:<br/><br/> - Juniper Networks Certified Internet Associate (JNCIA-ER)<br/> - Juniper Networks Certified Internet Specialist (JNCIS-ER)<br/> - Juniper Networks Certified Internet Expert (JNCIE-ER)<br/> With more services such as voice, conference, and multicast on the IP<br/> router platform, the market for enterprise routers is growing<br/> exponentially, and the need for certified engineers to keep up with<br/> network developments in protocols and security is paramount. For<br/> everyone who works with Juniper enterprise and edge routing<br/> environments, this is a must-have book.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>

<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i27.tinypic.com/nv63qc.jpg' border="0" /></div><br/><br/> Building on the success of its storefront and fulfillment services,<br/> Amazon now allows businesses to "rent" computing power, data storage and<br/> bandwidth on its vast network platform. This book demonstrates how<br/> developers working with small- to mid-sized companies can take advantage<br/> of Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as the Simple Storage Service (S3),<br/> Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Flexible<br/> Payments Service (FPS), and SimpleDB to build web-scale business<br/> applications. With AWS, Amazon offers a new paradigm for IT<br/> infrastructure: use what you need, as you need it, and pay as you go.<br/> Programming Web Services explains how you can access Amazon's open APIs<br/> to store and run applications, rather than spend precious time and<br/> resources building your own. With this book, you'll learn all the<br/> technical details you need to:<br/><br/> - Store and retrieve any amount of data using application servers,<br/> unlimited data storage, and bandwidth with the Amazon S3 service<br/> - Buy computing time using Amazon EC2's interface to requisition<br/> machines, load them with an application environment, manage access<br/> permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as needed<br/> - Use Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure to store messages as<br/> they travel between computers with Amazon SQS<br/> - Leverage the Amazon FPS service to structure payment instructions<br/> and allow the movement of money between any two entities, humans or<br/> computers<br/> - Create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and<br/> return the results using Amazon SimpleDB.<br/> - Scale up or down at a moment's notice, using these services to<br/> employ as much time and space as you need Whether you're starting a new<br/> online business, need to ramp up existing services, or require an<br/> offsite backup for your home, Programming Web Services gives you the<br/> background and the practical knowledge you need to start using AWS.<br/> Other books explain how to build web services. This book teaches<br/> businesses how to take make use of existing services from an established<br/> technology leader.<br/><br/> URL:<br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/>
