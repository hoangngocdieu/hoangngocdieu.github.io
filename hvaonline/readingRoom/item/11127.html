The security consequences for this <br/> ability are also discussed here.<br/> <br/> DETAILS<br/> <br/> Flash - Introduction<br/> -===================<br/> <br/> Flash player is a very popular browser add-on from Adobe (actually, Flash <br/> was invented by Macromedia, which was acquired<br/> by Adobe). This write-up covers mostly Flash 7 and Flash 8, together <br/> covering more than 94% of the Internet-enabled desktops (according to NPD <br/> Online Survey conducted April 2006, quoted in Adobe's website [1], [2]). <br/> Flash movies are delivered as SWF (ShockWave File) files. Adobe developed <br/> a rich Javascript-like language called ActionScript to provide scripting <br/> capabilities to Flash. One of the interesting features of ActionScript is <br/> its ability to send HTTP requests to 3rd party sites through the browser <br/> which invoked it. This is where Flash becomes interesting security-wise. <br/> With Flash it is possible to shape an outgoing request to a 3rd party site <br/> in ways not available from within "standard" Javascript. Specifically of <br/> interest is Flash's ability to send arbitrary HTTP request headers with <br/> outgoing HTTP requests.<br/> <br/> <br/> Sending arbitrary HTTP request headers with Flash<br/> -================================================<br/> <br/> The following is ActionScript 2.0 syntax for sending out a GET request (in <br/> this example, to<span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"> http://www.vuln.site/some/page.cgi?p1=v1&p2=v2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>) with an <br/> arbitrary HTTP header (Foo: Bar). This code works with Flash 7 and Flash 8 <br/> (probably with Flash 6 as well):<br/> <br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/> 		<div class="coded""><br/> 		<pre>var req:LoadVars=new LoadVars&#40;&#41;;<br/> req.addRequestHeader&#40;"Foo","Bar"&#41;;<br/> req.send&#40;"http://www.vuln.site/some/page.cgi?p1=v1&p2=v2",<br/>          "_blank","GET"&#41;;</pre><br/> 		</div><br/> <br/> A similar syntax will send POST request (with the same header, to the same <br/> URL, and with body a=b&c=d):<br/> <br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/> 		<div class="coded""><br/> 		<pre>var req:LoadVars=new LoadVars&#40;&#41;;<br/> req.addRequestHeader&#40;"Foo","Bar"&#41;;<br/> req.decode&#40;"a=b&c=d"&#41;;<br/> req.send&#40;"http://www.vuln.site/some/page.cgi?p1=v1&p2=v2",<br/>          "_blank","POST"&#41;;</pre><br/> 		</div><br/> <br/> (note: the LoadVars.decode() method was added in Flash 7, yet it's <br/> probably possible to compose an arbitrary POST body without it, so Flash 6 <br/> may be covered as well by this variant).<br/> <br/> The request is sent from the browser invoking the Flash object. Any <br/> cookies the browser normally sends, will be sent in those cases as well. <br/> The browser's User-Agent is sent, as well as all browser standard headers. <br/> HTTPS links are supported.<br/> <br/> This was successfully demonstrated with Microsoft IE 6.0, Microsoft IE 6.0 <br/> SP2 and FireFox 1.5.0.4, running Flash 8.0.22.0 and Flash 7.0.19.0.<br/> <br/> In IE, it is possible to overwrite some "normal" browser headers by simply <br/> calling addRequestHeader with the new value. This is applicable to both <br/> Referer and User-Agent. In FireFox 1.5.0.4, such headers, when used in <br/> addRequestHeader() will be appended to the HTTP request header section.<br/> <br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/> 		<div class="coded""><br/> 		<pre>// One UA in IE 6.0 SP2, two UAs in FF 1.5.0.4<br/> req.addRequestHeader&#40;"User-Agent","Hacker/1.0"&#41;;<br/> <br/> // One Referer in IE 6.0 SP2, two Referers in FF 1.5.0.4<br/> req.addRequestHeader&#40;"Referer","http://somewhere/"&#41;;</pre><br/> 		</div><br/> <br/> In IE, it is also possible to overwrite some more sensitive headers (e.g. <br/> Host and Content-Length) by appending colon to the header name (this <br/> technique was described in [3] in the context of XmlHttpRequest):<br/> <br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/> 		<div class="coded""><br/> 		<pre>req.addRequestHeader&#40;"Host:","foobar.site"&#41;;</pre><br/> 		</div><br/> <br/> This technique doesn't appear to work in FireFox 1.5.0.4.<br/> <br/> Note: when the target URL is in the same domain with the Flash movie, <br/> LoadVars may be used to read the HTTP response data, thus making LoadVars <br/> the basis for many Flash-based AJAX-like frameworks (in analogy to <br/> Javascript's XmlHttpRequest object).<br/> <br/> <br/> The security implications<br/> -========================<br/> <br/> The ability of an attacker to force a victim's browser to send HTTP <br/> requests to 3rd party sites with arbitrary HTTP request headers has impact <br/> on our understanding of web application security - both on assessment of <br/> security-related phenomena, and on the validity of some security <br/> mechanisms.<br/> <br/> It is important to understand that the attacks described here are (in <br/> themselves) not cross-site scripting attacks, neither are they (strictly <br/> speaking) any breach of cross-domain trust in the Flash object or between <br/> the Flash object and the embedding HTML page. They merely make use of the <br/> fact that it's possible to send requests from a Flash object to any URL, <br/> with almost any HTTP headers the attacker needs. This in itself is the <br/> problem, as it enables an attacker to send a link (to an HTML page <br/> embedding a Flash object, or directly to a Flash object residing at the <br/> attacker's website) that will cause a Flash object to be executed in the <br/> victim's browser. This Flash object will send the HTTP request (with HTTP <br/> headers chosen by the attacker) to a target website, and this in turn will <br/> compromise the security of the browser (victim).<br/> <br/> In other words, the implicit assumption made by many software developers <br/> (and probably also by many security researchers) that most HTTP headers <br/> cannot be forced to have arbitrary values by an attacker who serves data <br/> to the victim browser is shown to be in error in this write-up.<br/> <br/> Example 1 - The "Expect" header<br/> -------------------------------<br/> <br/> In [4], an injection problem was described wherein Apache 1.3.34, 2.0.57 <br/> and 2.2.1 are vulnerable to injecting HTML data (including malicious <br/> Javascript code) through the Expect header. In [5], yours truly commented, <br/> with respect to this issue, that "Regarding XSS This phenomenon is not XSS <br/> per-se. Unless someone can show me how it is possible to force a browser <br/> to send the Expect header to the target site". But using a Flash object, <br/> the attack is trivial (the author is therefore answering his own question <br/> here...). Consider a victim (browser) that clicks the following link: <br/><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"> http://www.evil.site/attack.swf</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/> <br/> This URL represents a Flash object that runs the following ActionScript <br/> code:<br/> <br/> <span class="quotetxt"><b>Code:</b></span><br/><br/> 		<div class="coded""><br/> 		<pre>var req:LoadVars=new LoadVars&#40;&#41;;<br/>   req.addRequestHeader&#40;"Expect",<br/>                        "&lt;script&gt;alert&#40;'gotcha!'&#41;&lt;/script&gt;"&#41;;<br/>   req.send&#40;"http://www.target.site/","_blank","GET"&#41;;</pre><br/> 		</div><br/> <br/> This ActionScript sends a request from the victim's browser, to the target <br/> website<span class="link"> www.target.site</span>) with an Expect header containing malicious HTML <br/> (Javascript) code. If the target website runs a vulnerable version of <br/> Apache, the net result is cross site scripting. So to be clear - there's a <br/> working XSS attack against Apache 1.3.34, 2.0.57 and 2.2.1 (as long as the <br/> client browser is IE or Firefox, and it supports Flash 6/7+). As noted in <br/> [5], for Apache 2.0/2.2 the XSS response is returned by the server only <br/> after the request timeout elapses (typically few minutes). Please note <br/> though that a fix for the Apache server is available at all 3 branches (as <br/> Apache 1.3.35, 2.0.58 and 2.2.2 respectively).<br/> <br/> Example 2 - CSRF and Referer<br/> ----------------------------<br/> <br/> CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attack is in essence the ability of an <br/> attacker to force a victim (browser) to effectively perform an action <br/> (send HTTP request) in a target site. This concept emerged several times, <br/> the first one probably on the Zope mailing list (as "Client Side Trojans", <br/> [6], and another time on BugTraq, under its now de-facto standard name, <br/> CSRF [7]. Both references suggest, among other measures, to rely on the <br/> HTTP Referer header as evidence that the browser emits the HTTP request <br/> from a link originating in the website. Indeed, considering the <br/> capabilities of HTML+Javascript, effectively spoofing the Referer is <br/> nearly impossible (one exception is [8], but it is effective only in a <br/> limited subset of scenarios; e.g. it is not effective when HTTPS is used). <br/> However, as can clearly be understood, with Flash this no longer holds, <br/> and Referer can be spoofed for requests to HTTPS resources, all the while <br/> having the browser send the site's cookies with the request. As <br/> demonstrated above, both GET requests (with arbitrary host and query <br/> parts) and POST requests (with arbitrary host and query parts, and body in <br/> the standard Content-Type format of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded") <br/> can be sent.<br/> <br/> Note: there are many other reasons not to rely on the Referer header, and <br/> this text is by no means the first one to warn against this practice.<br/> It should be obvious that any reasonable header (and combinations thereof) <br/> can be spoofed. In IE's case, the header provided by the attacker can <br/> replace the browser-provided header (e.g. Referer).<br/> In Firefox's case, the Referer spoofing technique may fail because Firefox <br/> adds the header at the bottom of the HTTP request headers. Still, some web <br/> applications may use the last value of the header, and as such be <br/> vulnerable to this technique.<br/> <br/> Plainly put, all this means that (reflective) cross site scripting attacks <br/> that make use of HTTP request headers (e.g. Referer, User-Agent, Expect, <br/> Host, Content-Type) to send the payload are now possible.<br/> <br/> <br/> Flash 9<br/> -======<br/> <br/> Flash 9 was announced June 28th, 2006 [9] (i.e. less than a month ago). In <br/> Flash 9, the techniques described above (for the LoadVars class) do not <br/> work for any browser-provided header (e.g. User-Agent, Host and Referer), <br/> nor probably for many "protected" headers such as Content-Length. Still, <br/> headers like Expect can be sent, so some attacks (e.g. Example 1 above) <br/> are still effective with Flash 9.<br/> <br/> <br/> Limitations of the technique<br/> -===========================<br/> <br/>  * The URL and the body part will always be URL-encoded. That is, it is <br/> impossible (so it seems) to force SP, HT, CR and   LF (and probably many <br/> other characters) to appear in their raw form in the request URL and body.<br/>  * Only GET and POST methods can be used.<br/>  * In IE, only one instance of each header can be sent.<br/> <br/>  * At large, the header section cannot be completely controlled, e.g. an <br/> attacker may have problems when attempting to send special characters <br/> inside headers.<br/> <br/> Partial solution<br/> -===============<br/> <br/> Notice the first limitation of the technique - it states that no raw CR <br/> and LF can be placed in the body section. This means that the technique <br/> cannot be used to send (POST) requests whose body complies with the <br/> "multipart/form-data" content-type format (this format uses raw CRs and <br/> LFs to mark headers and boundaries). In other words, a (POST) request <br/> whose body is a valid "multipart/form-data" stream is guaranteed (as far <br/> as today's knowledge extends) not to be sent from a Flash player. Web <br/> application authors can therefore use HTML forms whose ENCTYPE attribute <br/> is set to "multipart/form-data", and enforce that the submission contains <br/> a valid multipart/form-data body. Once these mechanisms are in place, and <br/> a request passes through, it is known not to originate from a Flash <br/> player, so the attack<br/> described here is irrelevant.<br/> <br/> This solution is of course intrusive - both the HTML pages and the <br/> receiving scripts must be altered to use (and enforce) <br/> multipart/form-data. With some web development platforms, this is trivial, <br/> yet in others (e.g. raw Perl, and ASP) it is not. Furthermore, in cases <br/> such as Example 1 above, the HTTP headers are interpreted and used by the <br/> (Apache) web server, and the control never reaches the web application <br/> layer, so in such cases, this solution is not applicable.<br/> <br/> Future directions<br/> -================<br/> <br/> HTTP Request Splitting ([8]) and HTTP Request Smuggling ([10]) - in IE + <br/> Flash 7/8 it is possible to send a Content-Length header with any value. <br/> This opens up an opportunity to perform HTTP Request Splitting attacks. <br/> Also, injecting Transfer-Encoding header, or a second Content-Length <br/> header may open up HTTP Request Smuggling. Further research is needed in <br/> order to understand whether these directions lead to viable exploitation <br/> techniques.<br/> <br/> Flash 9 - while experiments show that Flash 9 is more strict concerning <br/> which headers can be specified through LoadVars.addRequestHeader(), it's <br/> ActionScript 3.0 language is much richer than ActionScript 2.0. As such, <br/> it may open up several interesting opportunities at the HTTP level, e.g. <br/> the ability to send various HTTP methods, not just GET and POST (WebDAV <br/> anyone?). Flash 9 and ActionScript 3.0 should be studied better in order <br/> to understand what is their potential with respect to crafting HTTP <br/> requests.<br/> <br/> <br/> Conclusions<br/> -==========<br/> <br/> Relying on the authenticity of HTTP request headers when they are sent <br/> from a browser is not a good idea. Practically every header can be spoofed <br/> if the client can be forced to run a malicious Flash movie, and this is <br/> probably applicable to over 80% of the Internet desktops (i.e. Internet <br/> desktops running IE + Flash 7/ 8 ). Consequently, the applicability of cross <br/> site scripting attacks based on such headers, as well as cross site <br/> request forgery attacks (against sites which protect themselves by <br/> checking the Referer header) is higher than many people may perceive.<br/> <br/> A partial solution to the latter case was suggested in the write-up, <br/> however it is strongly tied to the specific technology used - Flash, and <br/> as such may not provide any protection against variants that make use of a <br/> different technology, or against developments in Flash itself. For <br/> cross-site request forgery, therefore, different solutions, not relying on <br/> Referer, should be considered.<br/> <br/> References<br/> -=========<br/> <br/> [1] "Technology Breakdown" (Adobe website)  <br/><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"> http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/tech_breakdown.html</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/> <br/> [2] "Macromedia Flash Player Version Penetration" (Adobe website)  <br/><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"><span class="link"> http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/> <br/> [3] "Re: 'Exploiting the XmlHttpRequest object in IE' -
