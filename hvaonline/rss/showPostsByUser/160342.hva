WPF offers amazing new opportunities to .NET programmers in terms of the user interfaces they can deliver to their customers. But this significant technological advance comes with a steep learning curve, requiring the programmer to learn new classes, new syntax, and an entirely new approach to UI development.

Although WPF has been generally available for over a year, commercial take–up has been relatively slow, and the publicly available body of knowledge has been weak in terms of real–world examples and best–practice information.

Using WPF Recipes in C# 2008, you’ll find a simple and straightforward approach to solving the problems you face every day. Each solution contains a complete, working example that demonstrates how to make the best use of WPF. You can use the example as a template to solve your own problem or as a base on which to build a solution tailored to your specific needs.

Packed with well–structured and documented solutions to a broad range of common WPF problems, this book, which presents the only WPF recipes currently published, will be a valuable addition to any C# programmer’s reference library. Examples included provide you with a rich source of information as you begin to learn and will be an invaluable quick–reference guide once you’re a proficient WPF programmer.

The emphasis on solving the day–to–day WPF problems that all programmers face frees you from needing to trawl through weighty programming tomes or sift through API documentation, allowing you to focus on the more interesting and innovative aspects of your project.

What you’ll learn

    * Get hands–on experience applying WPF to real–world business applications.
    * Find quick answers to common problems.
    * Develop a new mindset to UI development and a new approach to implementation from the authors’ experience in graphics.
    * Peruse clear and concise code samples that demonstrate solutions to specific problems.

Who is this book for?
This book will benefit intermediate–to–advanced professional C# programmers who want clearly documented and working code samples that demonstrate solutions to common problems encountered when programming WPF. The authors believe WPF technology is new and complex enough, and their experience is deep enough that their recipes will provide value to all but the most experienced WPF programmers.

About the Apress Recipes Series
Apress Recipes series books are carefully selected compendiums of solutions and techniques to help you solve the difficulties that regularly beset developers when they are learning a new language or technology. The recipes are short, and each provides a step–by–step explanation and working code example that allows you to successfully solve your problems and progress with your project.

				<title>Beginning C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>Beginning C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition</b>

<br>
			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RiVJc8qxL.jpg' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>

This book is for anyone who wants to write good C# code—even if you have never programmed before. Writing good code can be a challenge—there are so many options, especially in a .NET language like C#. If you want to really get the best from a programming language, you need to know which features work best in which situations and understand their strengths and weaknesses. It is this understanding that makes the difference between coding and coding well.

Beginning C# 2008: From Novice to Professional, Second Edition &lt;/em&gt; has been written to teach you how to use the C# programming language to solve problems. From the earliest chapters, and from the first introductory concepts, you’ll be looking at real–world programming challenges and learning how C# can be used to overcome them. As you progress through the book, the problems become more involved and interesting, while the solutions become correspondingly more complex and powerful as C# features interact to achieve the results that you want.

This second edition has been revised and improved to now include the latest SQL Server 2008 release and explain how you can integrate SQL Server 2008 with your C# applications.

By the time you’ve finished reading this book and worked through the sample exercises, you’ll be a confident and very competent C# programmer. You will still have many explorations of the .NET Framework API to look forward to, but you will have a firm foundation to build from, and you will know exactly where to go to find the things that you need to progress confidently in your projects.

What you’ll learn
    * Everything to get you started with C# 2008 from scratch—from installing the tools to writing your first applications.
    * The core concepts of .NET 3.5 programming: from decision trees to data structures, from exceptions to lambda expressions, and from objects to components.
    * Learn what LINQ is, why functional programming can be important, how generics make your life easier, and much, much, more!

Who is this book for
This book is for anyone who’s just starting out to learn about C#. It doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of object–oriented programming, of the .NET Framework, or of coding in general. It simply assumes that you’re an intelligent person who wants to learn and starts the journey from there.

About the Apress Beginning Series
The Beginning series from Apress is the right choice to get the information you need to land that crucial entry–level job. These books will teach you a standard and important technology from the ground up because they are explicitly designed to take you from “novice to professional.” You’ll start your journey by seeing what you need to know—but without needless theory and filler. You’ll build your skill set by learning how to put together real–world projects step by step. So whether your goal is your next career challenge or a new learning opportunity, the Beginning series from Apress will take you there—it is your trusted guide through unfamiliar territory!

				<title>The Definitive Guide to SOA: Oracle® Service Bus Second Edition</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>The Definitive Guide to SOA: Oracle® Service Bus Second Edition</b>

<br>
			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5179vgxUPqL.jpg' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>

The Definitive Guide to SOA: Oracle® Service Bus, Second Edition targets professional software developers and architects who know enterprise development but are new to enterprise service buses (ESBs) and service–oriented architecture (SOA) development. This is the first book to cover a practical approach to SOA using the BEA AquaLogic Service Bus tool. And it’s written from the “source”—BEA Systems AquaLogic product lead Jeff Davies

    * This book provides hands–on information to developing SOA–driven applications with ESBs as central components.
    * It also gives strategic guidance on SOA planning, web service life–cycle management, administration of an ESB, and security considerations.
    * Author Jeff Davies is careful to cut through theory and get straight to demonstrating successful use of the product.

What you’ll learn
    * View code examples that demonstrate how to use the major features of the service bus.
    * Learn tips and tricks to solve common problems.
    * Change your thinking on versioning web services: instead of applying versions to web services, which the author feels is simply the wrong tool for managing service life cycle, learn a new way to manage the service life cycle.
    * Get a new perspective on planning your “service landscape.”
    * Discover administration–specific details for keeping your ESB running with practical advice on moving your configurations from development to testing and production—details that are commonly omitted from technical books.

Who is this book for? 
This book is for developers, technical architects, tech leads, professional software developers ,and architects. It’s targeted at folks who know enterprise development but are new to enterprise service buses and SOA development.

				<title>Software Security Engineering: A Guide for Project Managers</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>Software Security Engineering: A Guide for Project Managers, (The SEI Series in Software Engineering) (Paperback )</b>

<br>
			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i26.tinypic.com/2i9379.jpg' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>

“This book’s broad overview can help an organization choose a set of
processes, policies, and techniques that are appropriate for its
security maturity, risk tolerance, and development style. This book will
help you understand how to incorporate practical security techniques
into all phases of the development lifecycle.”

–Steve Riley, senior security strategist, Microsoft Corporation

“There are books written on some of the topics addressed in this book,
and there are other books on secure systems engineering. Few address the
entire life cycle with a comprehensive overview and discussion of
emerging trends and topics as well as this one.”
–Ronda Henning, senior scientist-software/security queen, Harris
Corporation

Software that is developed from the beginning with security in mind will
resist, tolerate, and recover from attacks more effectively than would
otherwise be possible. While there may be no silver bullet for security,
there are practices that project managers will find beneficial. With
this management guide, you can select from a number of sound practices
likely to increase the security and dependability of your software, both
during its development and subsequently in its operation.

Software Security Engineering draws extensively on the systematic
approach developed for the Build Security In (BSI) Web site. Sponsored
by the Department of Homeland Security Software Assurance Program, the
BSI site offers a host of tools, guidelines, rules, principles, and
other resources to help project managers address security issues in
every phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC). The book’s
expert authors, themselves frequent contributors to the BSI site,
represent two well-known resources in the security world: the CERT
Program at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and Cigital, Inc., a
consulting firm specializing in software security.

This book will help you understand why
- Software security is about more than just eliminating
vulnerabilities and conducting penetration tests
- Network security mechanisms and IT infrastructure security services
do not sufficiently protect application software from security risks
- Software security initiatives should follow a risk-management
approach to identify priorities and to define what is “good
enough”–understanding that software security risks will change
throughout the SDLC
- Project managers and software engineers need to learn to think like
an attacker in order to address the range of functions that software
should not do, and how software can better resist, tolerate, and recover
when under attack

“Wow, what a compendium of great information and how-to’s! I am so
impressed! Elliotte’s written a book whose title comes nowhere near to
doing it justice. Covering much more than just refactoring, this book
explains how to do it right the first time around, in a clear and lucid
voice. Harold obviously knows his stuff. A must-read!”
—Howard Katz, Proprietor, Fatdog Software

“After working with people who require the skills and tools necessary
to continually improve the quality and security of their applications, I
have discovered a missing link. The ability to rebuild and recode
applications is a key area of weakness for web designers and web
application developers alike. By building refactoring into the
development process, incremental changes to the layout or internals
efficiently averts a total rewrite or complete make-over. This is a
fantastic book for anyone who needs to rebuild, recode, or refactor the
web.”
—Andre Gironda, tssci-security.com

“Elliotte’s book provides a rare collection of hints and tricks that
will vastly improve the quality of web pages. Virtually any serious HTML
developer, new or tenured, in any size organization will reap tremendous
benefit from implementing even a handful of his suggestions.”
—Matt Lavallee, Development Manager, MLS Property Information Network,
Inc. Like any other software system, Web sites gradually accumulate
“cruft” over time. They slow down. Links break. Security and
compatibility problems mysteriously appear. New features don’t integrate
seamlessly. Things just don’t work as well. In an ideal world, you’d
rebuild from scratch. But you can’t: there’s no time or money for that.
Fortunately, there’s a solution: You can refactor your Web code using
easy, proven techniques, tools, and recipes adapted from the world of
software development. In Refactoring HTML, Elliotte Rusty Harold
explains how to use refactoring to improve virtually any Web site or
application. Writing for programmers and non-programmers alike, Harold
shows how to refactor for better reliability, performance, usability,
security, accessibility, compatibility, and even search engine
placement. Step by step, he shows how to migrate obsolete code to
today’s stable Web standards, including XHTML, CSS, and REST—and
eliminate chronic problems like presentation-based markup, stateful
applications, and “tag soup.”

The book’s extensive catalog of detailed refactorings and practical
“recipes for success” are organized to help you find specific solutions
fast, and get maximum benefit for minimum effort. Using this book, you
can quickly improve site performance now—and make your site far easier
to enhance, maintain, and scale for years to come. Topics covered
include

•&nbsp;Recognizing the “smells” of Web code that should be refactored
• Transforming old HTML into well-formed, valid XHTML, one step at a
time
•&nbsp;Modernizing existing layouts with CSS
• Updating old Web applications: replacing POST with GET, replacing
old contact forms, and refactoring JavaScript
•&nbsp;Systematically refactoring content and links
• Restructuring sites without changing the URLs your users rely upon
This book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,
developers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates
existing sites. It will be especially helpful to Web professionals who
learned HTML years ago, and want to refresh their knowledge with today’s
standards-compliant best practices. This book will be an indispensable

Mashups are big; everybody and their dog are creating new and
interesting ways of combining information on the Web. But if all the
talk of APIs and complex code leaves you cold, you’ll be pleased to meet
Microsoft Popfly. Popfly was created as a tool for designers to build
mashups in a visual manner, rapidly, without needing to know any code.
By simply dragging out “blocks” that represent services such as Flickr
onto your workspace and then drawing connection lines between them, you
can create a mashup. It’s as easy as that!

Get Popfly and Silverlight up and running on your computer, and then
learn how to use the Popfly Mashup Creator and Popfly Web Page Creator
to share your mashups with the world. Author Eric Griffin will introduce
you to Popfly and show you everything you need to start creating your
own hybrid web applications.

- Build mashups visually without the need to know any code.
- Leverage technologies such as Flickr and Google Maps.
- Save your creation as a Vista Sidebar Gadget.

What you’ll learn:

- How to get Popfly and Silverlight up and running on your computer
- How to use the Popfly Mashup Creator
- How to combine blocks to create mashups
- How to create web pages in the Popfly Web Page Creator
- How to share your mashups with the world
- How to save your mashups on your Vista desktop

				<title>Creating Mashups with Adobe Flex and AIR (Paperback)</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>Creating Mashups with Adobe Flex and AIR (Paperback)</b>

Web applications no longer need be powered by any one individual's data,
and they don't need to be confined to the desktop. Developers can draw
on a wealth of publicly available content, from providers such as
Flickr, Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Last.fm, and combine it for use in
their own applications. Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) makes it simple
to bring previously web-only applications to the desktop, allowing them
to run alongside traditional applications on an end user's computer. In
this book, you'll learn how to create mashup applications from the vast
array of web services, feeds, and APIs using Adobe Flash and Flex
together with HTML and JavaScript (Ajax). You'll be introduced to the
various sources of information and the tools necessary to gather and
reuse that information, and then you'll learn how to combine that
content in a variety of ways. You'll learn how to have desktop
applications interact with online services such as Flickr, you'll learn
how to use Amazon S3 for enterprise-level data storage, and you'll
embrace technologies such as OpenID. In addition, you'll create abstract
visualizations based on music sourced from Last.fm and consume Twitter
content via RSS. You will also see how to use the Flash-native data
format SWX along with PHP to create a Yahoo! weather widget. You'll
discover just why you may want to build a widget or a desktop
application rather leaving things web-based; then you'll create an
application using Flex Builder and AIR and learn how best to distribute
it. With so many tools and so much data available, the possibilities for
mashup creation are endless. Creating Mashups with Adobe Flex and AIR
provides all you need to get you up and running quickly, while also
giving you a solid understanding of the technologies involved so you can
take things furtherto a place limited only by your imagination.

In this book you'll learn:

- how to use Flex 3 in conjunction with ActionScript 3.0 to build
powerful applications;
- how you can use Adobe AIR to take your application from the Web and
onto the desktop;
- the differences between developing for the Web and for the desktop;
- how you can use the APIs of popular web services such as Flickr,
Amazon, Google, Twitter, and Last.fm as data sources for your
application; and
- how to optimize your applications for fast and efficient
performance.

				<title>PHP 6 and MySQL 5 for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>PHP 6 and MySQL 5 for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide</b>

It hasn't taken Web developers long to discover that when it comes to creating dynamic, database-driven Web sites, MySQL and PHP provide a winning open source combination. Add this book to the mix, and there's no limit to the powerful, interactive Web sites that developers can create. With step-by-step instructions, complete scripts, and expert tips to guide readers, veteran author and database designer Larry Ullman gets right down to business: After grounding readers with separate discussions of first the scripting language (PHP) and then the database program (MySQL), he goes on to cover security, sessions and cookies, and using additional Web tools, with several sections devoted to creating sample applications. This guide is indispensable for intermediate- to advanced level Web designers who want to replace their static sites with something dynamic. In this edition, the bulk of the new material covers the latest versions of both technologies: PHP 6 (due out in 2008) and MySQL 5 (available now). The book's publication date is likely to beat the official release of PHP 6, making it one of the first books available on the subject.

				<title>Essential Linux Device Drivers [IMPORT] (Hardcover)</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>Essential Linux Device Drivers [IMPORT] (Hardcover)</b>

“Probably the most wide ranging and complete Linux device driver book
I’ve read.”
--Alan Cox, Linux Guru and Key Kernel Developer

“Very comprehensive and detailed, covering almost every single Linux
device driver type.”
--Theodore Ts’o, First Linux Kernel Developer in North America and Chief
Platform Strategist of the Linux Foundation

The Most Practical Guide to Writing Linux Device Drivers
Linux now offers an exceptionally robust environment for driver
development: with today’s kernels, what once required years of
development time can be accomplished in days. In this practical,
example-driven book, one of the world’s most experienced Linux driver
developers systematically demonstrates how to develop reliable Linux
drivers for virtually any device. Essential Linux Device Drivers is for
any programmer with a working knowledge of operating systems and C,
including programmers who have never written drivers before.
Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran focuses on the essentials, bringing together
all the concepts and techniques you need, while avoiding topics that
only matter in highly specialized situations. Venkateswaran begins by
reviewing the Linux 2.6 kernel capabilities that are most relevant to
driver developers. He introduces simple device classes; then turns to
serial buses such as I2C and SPI; external buses such as PCMCIA, PCI,
and USB; video, audio, block, network, and wireless device drivers;
user-space drivers; and drivers for embedded Linux–one of today’s
fastest growing areas of Linux development. For each, Venkateswaran
explains the technology, inspects relevant kernel source files, and
walks through developing a complete example.

• Addresses drivers discussed in no other book, including drivers for
I2C, video, sound, PCMCIA, and different types of flash memory
• Demystifies essential kernel services and facilities, including kernel
threads and helper interfaces
• Teaches polling, asynchronous notification, and I/O control
• Introduces the Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol for embedded Linux
drivers
• Covers multimedia device drivers using the Linux-Video subsystem and
Linux-Audio framework
• Shows how Linux implements support for wireless technologies such as
Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi, and cellular networking
• Describes the entire driver development lifecycle, through debugging
and maintenance
• Includes reference appendixes covering Linux assembly, BIOS calls, and
Seq files

				<title> Java CAPS Basics: Implementing Common EAI Patterns (Hardcover)</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b> Java CAPS Basics: Implementing Common EAI Patterns (Hardcover)</b>

Use Java CAPS to Streamline IT Services and Leverage Legacy Applications
Design patterns are a useful tool for streamlining enterprise
integration and Web development projects: the mission-critical projects
that directly impact your competitiveness. Enterprise Integration
Patterns by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison-Wesley, 2004)
described many of the most useful patterns for enterprise developers.
Until recently, however, implementing the patterns in that classic
reference required the extensive use of raw Java code. Now there’s a
better alternative: Using Sun’s Java Composite Application Suite (Java
CAPS), architects and developers can implement enterprise integration
patterns succinctly, elegantly, and completely. In Java™ CAPS Basics,
Sun’s own Java CAPS experts show how to quickly put these new tools and
technologies to work in your real-world enterprise application
integration projects. After reviewing the challenges of enterprise
integration, they introduce Java CAPS and show how it can simplify the
development of today’s state-of-the-art “composite” applications. Next,
they bridge the gap between abstract pattern languages and practical
implementation details. You will learn essential Java CAPS concepts and
methods in the context of the patterns you’ll actually use for
real-world message and system management. Coverage includes
- Comparing approaches to enterprise application integration and
finding ways to integrate non-invasively, with fewer changes and lower
costs
- Mastering the core integration tools provided by Java CAPS: eGate,
eInsight, eWays and JMS
- Using enterprise integration patterns to improve application
reusability, scalability, resilience, security, and manageability
- Implementing patterns for message exchange, correlation,
infrastructure, routing, construction, transformation, and endpoints
- Generating and using cryptographic objects such as X.509
Certificates, PKCS#12, and JKS Keystores
- Using advanced techniques such as solution partitioning and
subprocess implementation, many of which are covered nowhere else
- Constructing two complete example solutions that bring together many
of the patterns discussed and illustrated in this book The companion CD
contains detailed illustrations for most of the relevant patterns and
two complete Java CAPS-based case studies (with solutions) that
implement a number of the patterns discussed in the book. In addition,
Part II contains a chapter on cryptographic objects used to configure
security-related aspects of the suite. It also provides more than sixty
detailed examples designed to illustrate the concepts and patterns
presented in this book. Built with JCAPS eDesigner, these graphical,
component-based examples can easily be used by business analysts and
others with or without strong coding skills.
