Outpost Security Suite - a robust combination of award-winning firewall, fast and effective anti-malware, personalized antispam and proactive Host Protection module to defend against the majority of Internet risks. Includes automated configuration service and other user aids.
Outpost Security Suite Pro provides the first line of defense against rogue software by proactively controlling how programs behave and interact on a PC. The Host Protection safeguard, which proactively monitors for and blocks the kinds of sophisticated hacking techniques used to compromise or steal data, means that malicious activity is no longer possible. By analyzing threats and displaying actionable alerts, Host Protection stops zero-day attacks and shields the computer against inappropriate operations, rendering it “defended in advance” against security risks like botnets and inadvertent data disclosure.

Outpost Security Suite Pro:
• Firewall with Advanced Features
• Basic Host Protection
• Advanced Host Protection
• Anti-spyware
• Antivirus with SmartScan Technology
• Anti-spam

Outpost Security Suite Pro Benefits:
• Acclaimed firewall
Outpost Firewall Pro has been gathering awards for years and is a proven robust barrier against spyware, hackers, bandwidth theft, and information loss, preventing any unauthorized access to your PC.
• ID theft prevention
Outpost Security Suite Pro is constantly on guard against any attempt to steal or otherwise compromise your confidential data, passing every leak test with flying colors.
• Anti-virus and Anti-spyware Agnitum Antimalware Technote
Outpost Security Suite Pro combines the award-winning Outpost anti-spyware engine with VirusBuster’s 100% certified anti-virus engine to deliver all-in-one anti-malware (anti-virus + anti-spyware) protection that’s fast, efficient, and effective against known and unknown threats.
• Bullet-proof defense
Outpost Security Suite Pro uses specialized techniques to ensure that its own protection cannot be disabled by targeted malware that’s designed to do just that.
• Personalized anti-spam
Train the Outpost Security Suite anti-spam engine to recognize what’s spam and what’s valuable to you, so your inbox gets cleaner every time you open your email.
• Power without complexity
Whether you’re a security novice or expert, Outpost Security Suite Pro is easily configured to meet your needs. Use the built-in help as much (or as little) as you need; automate as much (or as little) as you want); and take advantage of ImproveNet to benefit from the experience of other users. The interface is intuitive and easy to explore and, whatever settings you choose, you’ll have the protection you need.

This latest product delivers a long list of additional threat protections and enhancements for users of Microsoft Vista:
- Protection against potentially harmful websites. Sites with a bad reputation or that harbor suspected malware are automatically blocked.
- Combined anti-malware engine. The anti-malware module combines anti-spyware and anti-virus in the same process to deliver fast, efficient, easy-to-use protection.
- Pre-emptive protection. Behavior monitoring ensures malware and other threats will be stopped before they can activate on the PC. Robust host protection detects and stops unauthorized activity, preventing new attacks and blocking threats at the earliest possible stage.
- Personalized anti-spam. The integral Bayesian anti-spam filter learns what you consider spam and applies automated rules based on that information.
- Robust, flexible self-protection. OSS 2008 detects if any application is attempting to interfere with its own operations and prevents the program from being disabled by malware.
- Usability. The flexible Vista-style interface offers a wealth of options for advanced users to configure, but the out-of-the-box settings provide high levels of automated protection for a range of users, no matter how technically proficient. Three toolbar buttons provide for easier access by less experienced users.

				<title>AIO Defrags tools</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <font color='orange'><font size='+1'>AIO Defrags tools</font></font>

<br>

Auslogics Disk Defrag 1.4.13.300


Disk fragmentation leads to system slowdowns, PC crashes, slow startup and shutdown and sometimes to system failures. Auslogics Disk Defrag is designed for fast optimization of today's modern hard disks.

Auslogics Disk Defrag is a compact, manual defragmentation tool that supports FAT 16, FAT 32, and NTFS (with compressed and encrypted files). For the individual user, Disk Defrag is more than adequate for the job of maintaining high-level disk performance.

Why Defragment Disks ?

Hard disks are by far the slowest component in your computer. CPU and memory work much faster than hard disks because they do not have moving parts. Therefore fragmented disks often become a bottleneck of the system performance.

Besides causing slowdowns, fragmentation makes the hard drive disk heads move frequently when reading files which leads to freeze-ups and system crashes. It is important to keep your disks defragmented and optimized as much as possible.

· Improve computer performance and stability
· Increase your productivity - no more waiting for files to open
· Defragment disks in only a few minutes
· Useful disk fragmentation map and detailed fragmentation report
· Windows XP Home and Professional, 2000/2003 and Vista supported

What's New in Auslogics Disk Defrag 1.4.13.300 :

· adds an integration with BoostSpeed
· improves the setup process
· fixes bugs

Defraggler 1.01.064


Defraggler differs from other defrag tools on the market, by enabling you to quickly and simply defrag the files you want to, without having to process the whole drive.

Simply run Defraggler, select the file and defragment in seconds. No more struggling with the Windows defragmentation tool!

Features of Defraggler 1.01 :

• Defrag Individual Files
Most defragmentation tools only let you defrag the whole drive. Defraggler gives you the power to select individual files and folders to defrag. So you can get the job done in seconds, rather than waiting for the whole drive to complete. Of course if you want to defrag the whole drive Defraggler will let you do that too.
• Compact and Portable
Defraggler was written in the same compact architecture as other Piriform products (CCleaner and Recuva). This results in a compact single EXE application, which can be copied to a thumbdrive and then used whenever you need it, without a complex installation process. The EXE itself is less than 1MB!
• Vista Support
Defraggler supports all OSs released since Windows 2000, this includes Windows 2000, 2003, XP and Vista. Although 64-bit support is not included in this version, we are working on compatibility, so it will be available soon! Additionally Defraggler supports both NTFS and FAT32 file systems.
• Locate Files on the Drive
After analysis Defraggler lists all the fragmented files on the drive. Selecting one or many will highlight their location on the disk. Allowing you to visually see the location of files on the disk.
• Freeware
Why pay hundreds of dollars for a commercial defragmentation tool, when you can use Defraggler for free! This includes corporate use as well!

What's New in Defraggler 1.01.064 Beta :

· Added df.exe command line version
· Added option to change process priority
· Fixed issue with files in the MFT buffer zone
· Fixed bug that left files in the list after they were defragged
· Minor bug fixes



ScanDefrag 5.5


ScanDefrag is a small windows application that configures Microsoft's, Norton's, or JKessel's disk utilities as part of the next Windows' startup process.

This can result in less restarts and cleaner runs of these programs. A very nice utility that will run maintenance programs as early as possible in the Windows startup. Please read the readme file for more information and features available.

· Optional computer shutdown or restart when complete.
· Choice of Norton Disk Doctor or Microsoft Scandisk or Chkdsk.

• boost speed of your PC in just a few minutes
• speed up Internet for faster browsing and downloads
• clean the registry to make your computer more stable
• clean the disks of your PC for higher system performance
• boost programs such as MS Office, Media Player, etc.

AusLogics BoostSpeed - the ideal solution to keep your PC running faster, cleaner and error-free. This powerful optimization suite will boost Internet connections, tweak Windows to its peak performance, clean registry and block annoying ads. It's a great way to keep your computer clean and optimized.

Speed Up PC With BoostSpeed
Modify Windows settings, file system and services to greatly increase system performance. Increase startup and shutdown speed, disable annoying CD autorun and error reporting features. BoostSpeed will keep monitoring your system for possible optimizations and let you know if such optimizations are possible. You can also run the System Optimization Wizard to periodically optimize your PC.

Speed Up Internet
Adjust your PC for faster images, music and software downloads, increased browsing speed and reliable Internet connections. View your download speed and graphs. To gain additional performance boost you can also turn on DNS Optimization.

Block Banner Advertisements
Tired of annoying banner advertisements accompanying many web sites? Now you can eliminate advertisements and also speed up your Internet browsing with BoostSpeed Banner Killer! You can add your own web sites to the black list to block them from showing their advertisements.

Keep Disk and Registry Clean

Keep your PC fast and safe
BoostSpeed will detect most of the popular "PC-slowers" - bundle-software (such as eDonkey or Kazaa) which silently download malware and spyware to your computer, taking up internet traffic and slowing down the system. This will also keep your system safe from prying eyes of spyware programs.

Boost Software Products
BoostSpeed can improve performance of different software products, including Microsoft Office, Internet browsers (such as Internet Explorer, Opera, Mozzila), E-mail clients (Outlook, The Bat), MSN Messenger, ICQ, Media Player and others.

System Optimization Tools
Greatly increase your PC startup speed with Autorun Manager, where you can disable or remove the programs which try to load up when Windows starts up. Force-uninstall unwanted software products which take up space on your computer and slow it down.

Networks Tools
Keep your connection alive while you're away, synchronize your computer clock with atomic clock over the Internet, lookup domain names and IP addresses, measure your Internet connection speed. Troubleshoot and improve your Internet connection and local network with an excellent selection of network management tools.

Prepare yourself with this complete collection of ammo,
before you enter the Computer Underground


PLEASE NOTE

Some stupid antivirus and antispyware programs flag some h4cking tools as being infected/malware,
although the application is perfectly safe and does not pose a threat to your system.
This is called a 'false positive'.
The term false positive is used when antivirus software wrongly classifies an innocuous (inoffensive) file as a virus.
The incorrect detection may be due to heuristics or to an incorrect virus signature in a database.
Similar problems can occur with antitrojan or antispyware software.

Description:

DirectX 10 is the latest version of the DirectX suite of multimedia application programming interfaces that Microsoft has built exclusively into its latest operating system, Windows Vista. Gaming enthusiasts will only be able to access DirectX 10 via a combination of one of the latest video cards and one of the editions of Windows Vista. These libraries allow the use of DirectX 10 games on platforms other than Microsoft Vista, and increase hardware compatibility even on Vista, by compiling Geometry Shaders down to native machine code for execution where hardware isn't capable of running it. No longer will you have to upgrade your OS and video card(s) to play the latest games," revealed Cody Brocious, Lead Engineer on the Alky Project.

With Windows Vista, Microsoft has also overhauled the DirectX driver architecture in the operating system. However, Microsoft does not offer backward compatibility with previous Windows platforms for the new Windows Display Driver Model in Vista.
These libraries allow the use of DirectX 10 games on platforms other than Microsoft Vista and increase hardware compatibility..

The current preview allows you to run a number of examples from the DirectX SDK on Windows XP. They're not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but we want to whet your appetite. We hope to release builds in the coming months progressing from demos to fully functional games.

How to Install?

Inside this zip is a README.TXT file with complete instructions on where to install the files (don't worry, we'll have an installer in the near future) and how to get and run the examples from the SDK.
