Violent Python shows you how to move from a theoretical understanding of offensive computing concepts to a practical implementation. Instead of relying on another attacker's tools, this book will teach you to forge your own weapons using the Python programming language. This book demonstrates how to write Python scripts to automate large-scale network attacks, extract metadata, and investigate forensic artifacts. It also shows how to write code to intercept and analyze network traffic using Python, craft and spoof wireless frames to attack wireless and Bluetooth devices, and how to data-mine popular social media websites and evade modern anti-virus.

Just as a professional athlete doesn’t show up without a solid game plan, ethical hackers, IT professionals, and security researchers should not be unprepared, either. The Hacker Playbook provides them their own game plans. Written by a longtime security professional and CEO of Secure Planet, LLC, this step-by-step guide to the “game” of penetration hacking features hands-on examples and helpful advice from the top of the field.

Through a series of football-style “plays,” this straightforward guide gets to the root of many of the roadblocks people may face while penetration testing—including attacking different types of networks, pivoting through security controls, and evading antivirus software.

From “Pregame” research to “The Drive” and “The Lateral Pass,” the practical plays listed can be read in order or referenced as needed. Either way, the valuable advice within will put you in the mindset of a penetration tester of a Fortune 500 company, regardless of your career or level of experience.

Whether you’re downing energy drinks while desperately looking for an exploit, or preparing for an exciting new job in IT security, this guide is an essential part of any ethical hacker’s library—so there’s no reason not to get in the game.

			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://i1212.photobucket.com/albums/cc453/nhanlaihong0000/51s-CPI2hNL_BO2204203200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-clickTopRight35-76_AA300_SH20_OU01__zps5adf78f9.jpg' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>



Analyzing how hacks are done, so as to stop them in the future

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing hardware or software and understanding it, without having access to the source code or design documents. Hackers are able to reverse engineer systems and exploit what they find with scary results. Now the good guys can use the same tools to thwart these threats. Practical Reverse Engineering goes under the hood of reverse engineering for security analysts, security engineers, and system programmers, so they can learn how to use these same processes to stop hackers in their tracks.

The book covers x86, x64, and ARM (the first book to cover all three); Windows kernel-mode code rootkits and drivers; virtual machine protection techniques; and much more. Best of all, it offers a systematic approach to the material, with plenty of hands-on exercises and real-world examples.

				<description><![CDATA[ 1,Jeff Atwood, "Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code"
ISBN: 147830054X | 2012 | EPUB/MOBI | 278 pages | 5 MB/4 MB
 
<br>
			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8277/0025240e.jpg' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>

Jeff Atwood began the Coding Horror blog in 2004, and is convinced that it changed his life. He needed a way to keep track of software development over time - whatever he was thinking about or working on. He researched subjects he found interesting, then documented his research with a public blog post, which he could easily find and refer to later. Over time, increasing numbers of blog visitors found the posts helpful, relevant and interesting. Now, approximately 100,000 readers visit the blog per day and nearly as many comment and interact on the site. Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code is your one-stop shop for all things programming. Jeff writes with humor and understanding, allowing for both seasoned programmers and newbies to appreciate the depth of his research. From such posts as "The Programmer's Bill of Rights" and "Why Cant Programmers... Program?" to "Working With the Chaos Monkey," this book introduces the importance of writing responsible code, the logistics involved, and how people should view it more as a lifestyle than a career. TABLE OF CONTENTS - Introduction - The Art of Getting ~love~ Done - Principles of Good Programming - Hiring Programmers the Right Way - Getting Your Team to Work Together - The Batcave: Effective Workspaces for Programmers - Designing With the User in Mind - Security Basics: Protecting Your Users' Data - Testing Your Code, So it Doesn't Suck More Than it Has To - Building, Managing and Benefiting from a Community - Marketing Weasels and How Not to Be One - Keeping Your Priorities Straight EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK As a software developer, you are your own worst enemy. The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be.I know you have the best of intentions. We all do. We're software developers; we love writing code. It's what we do. We never met a problem we couldn't solve with some duct tape, a jury-rigged coat hanger and a pinch of code. But Wil Shipley argues that we should rein in our natural tendencies to write lots of code: The fundamental nature of coding is that our task, as programmers, is to recognize that every decision we make is a trade-off. To be a master programmer is to understand the nature of these trade-offs, and be conscious of them in everything we write.In coding, you have many dimensions in which you can rate code: Brevity of codeFeaturefulnessSpeed of executionTime spent codingRobustnessFlexibility Now, remember, these dimensions are all in opposition to one another. You can spend three days writing a routine which is really beautiful and fast, so you've gotten two of your dimensions up, but you've spent three days, so the "time spent coding" dimension is way down.So, when is this worth it? How do we make these decisions? The answer turns out to be very sane, very simple, and also the one nobody, ever, listens to: Start with brevity. Increase the other dimensions as required by testing. I couldn't agree more. I've given similar advice when I exhorted developers to Code Smaller. And I'm not talking about a reductio ad absurdum contest where we use up all the clever tricks in our books to make the code fit into less physical space. I'm talking about practical, sensible strategies to reduce the volume of code an individual programmer has to read to understand how a program works. Here's a trivial little example of what I'm talking about: if (s == String.Empty)if (s == "") It seems obvious to me that the latter case is... ...buy the book to read more!

Programming is now parallel programming. Much as structured programming revolutionized traditional serial programming decades ago, a new kind of structured programming, based on patterns, is relevant to parallel programming today. Parallel computing experts and industry insiders Michael McCool, Arch Robison, and James Reinders describe how to design and implement maintainable and efficient parallel algorithms using a pattern-based approach. They present both theory and practice, and give detailed concrete examples using multiple programming models. Examples are primarily given using two of the most popular and cutting edge programming models for parallel programming: Threading Building Blocks, and Cilk Plus. These architecture-independent models enable easy integration into existing applications, preserve investments in existing code, and speed the development of parallel applications. Examples from realistic contexts illustrate patterns and themes in parallel algorithm design that are widely applicable regardless of implementation technology.

The patterns-based approach offers structure and insight that developers can apply to a variety of parallel programming models
Develops a composable, structured, scalable, and machine-independent approach to parallel computing
Includes detailed examples in both Cilk Plus and the latest Threading Building Blocks, which support a wide variety of computers

Software Engineering: A Lifecycle Approach traces the development of the four-decade-old discipline of Software Engineering and compiles the important historical and modern concepts, approaches, and tools of software development, grouping them as chapters specific to phases in the software development lifecycle. Two distinguishing features of the book are: (i) A strong emphasis on the engineering aspects of software development with the total exclusion of the topics on software project management, and (ii) An elaborate coverage of the requirement analysis.

The former has enabled the author to focus on the engineering aspects of the subject, and the latter makes an improvement over the deficiencies of other books on the subject, which often make passing reference to this very important phase of software development. Another highlight of the book is the reference to a large number of original sources from which much of the contents has been drawn.

The book is organized in 24 chapters, with two chapters devoted to the Basics, eight chapters to Requirements, six chapters to Design, two chapters to Detailed Design and Coding, five chapters to Testing, and one chapter to Beyond Development of Software.

Contents:
The Basics- Introduction Software Development Life Cycles

As programmers, we’ve all seen source code that’s so ugly and buggy it makes our brain ache. Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of "bad code" (much of it their own) to determine why they’re bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it—even if that someone else is you.

This book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand.

- Simplify naming, commenting, and formatting with tips that apply to every line of code;
- Refine your program’s loops, logic, and variables to reduce complexity and confusion;
- Attack problems at the function level, such as reorganizing blocks of code to do one task at a time;
- Write effective test code that is thorough and concise—as well as readable.

"Being aware of how the code you create affects those who look at it later is an important part of developing software. The authors did a great job in taking you through the different aspects of this challenge, explaining the details with instructive examples."

If you've asked someone the secret to writing efficient, well-written software, the answer that you've probably gotten is "learn assembly language programming." By learning assembly language programming, you learn how the machine really operates and that knowledge will help you write better high-level language code. A dirty little secret assembly language programmers rarely admit to, however, is that what you really need to learn is machine organization, not assembly language programming. Write Great Code, the first in a series from assembly language expert Randall Hyde, dives right into machine organization without the extra overhead of learning assembly language programming at the same time. And since Write Great Code concentrates on the machine organization, not assembly language, the reader will learn in greater depth those subjects that are language-independent and of concern to a high level language programmer. Write Great Code will help programmers make wiser choices with respect to programming statements and data types when writing software, no matter which language they use.

It's a critical lesson that today's computer science students aren't always being taught: How to carefully choose their high-level language statements to produce efficient code. Write Great Code, Volume 2: Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level shows software engineers what too many college and university courses don't - how compilers translate high-level language statements and data structures into machine code. Armed with this knowledge, they will make informed choices concerning the use of those high-level structures and help the compiler produce far better machine code - all without having to give up the productivity and portability benefits of using a high-level language.

				<title>SQL injection table doesnt exist</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ Mình dùng sql injection để hack 1 site shop ( xin ko tiện nói ở đây) đã tìm ra chính xác bảng login của admin là admin_login. Nhưng khi sử dụng union select để truy vấn username, password thì nó báo Lỗi "Table 'mbstech_newstore.admin_login' doesn't exist " .Mình đoán chắc là nó sử dụng lọc, nên đã tìm ra chính xác bảng login là admin_login rồi mà nó vẫn báo là bảng ko tồn tại. Câu truy vấn cuối của mình là
http://site.com/productInfo.php?productID=-118%20union%20select%201,2,3,group_concat%28id,0x3a,uname,0x3a,pwd,0x3a,email%20%29,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18%20from%20admin_login
Vậy có bạn nào biết cách truy vấn để bypass cái này ko, mình bí quá, thank trước]]></description>
