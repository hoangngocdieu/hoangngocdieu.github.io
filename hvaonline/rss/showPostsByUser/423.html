				<title>Re: Từng buớc một để triển khai hệ thống Cluster </title>

		<blockquote>Mình có chút thắc mắc là kĩ thuật tạo cluster với Linux Virtual Server ko biết có giúp chạy ứng dụng với khả năng chịu tải và chịu lỗi cao hay ko hay chỉ là hệ thống Cluster với kĩ khả năng tính toán đa luồng MultiThread và chỉ dùng để chạy các Application đa luồng ?&nbsp;
		</blockquote>
Giải pháp cho vấn đề này là rocks clusters - www.rocksclusters.org chứ không phải LVS.

				<title>Tại sao việc xác thực chữ ký và thực tính lại quan trọng</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ Bạn hoclinux nên đọc kỹ phần trả lời của Khoai thì sẽ tìm ra câu trả lời. Nếu "làm biếng" search thì bạn có thể theo link sau:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy

Nói nôm na dễ hiểu thì như thề này nhé. 

Bạn cũng biết là đa phần các phần mềm mã nguồn mở  thì cộng đồng hay bất cứ cá nhân nào cũng đều có thể thêm/bớt và thay đổi mã nguồn vào bất cứ lúc nào. Việc kẻ xấu giả mạo mã nguồn từ nhà phát hành gốc (NPH) bằng cách thêm các đoạn mã xấu vào mã nguồn gốc rồi phát tán trên mạng như một gói chính thức của NPH sẽ gây ra những hiểm họa cho cộng đồng mã mở. Do đó việc NPH đưa ra chữ ký điện tử để người dùng xác nhận mã nguồn đó là mã nguồn gốc là một việc cực kỳ cần thiết và mang tính sống còn của cộng đồng mã mở (và cả mả đóng).

				<title>Back-End (BE_config.php) - Remote Include Files </title>
				<description><![CDATA[ Theo tôi thì cứ dựa trên ngày public lỗi trên hệ thống bugtraq mà công nhận ai phát hiện ra lỗi trước. Các bạn nên xây dựng với tinh thần góp ý và ít đả kích lại một chút thì cộng đồng sẽ phát triển tốt hơn.

Vài ý kiến.
