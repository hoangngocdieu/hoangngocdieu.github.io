TITLE: Flash Web Design - The art of motion graphics (The v5 remix)
PUBLISHER: New Riders
ISBN: 0-7357-1098-8
PAGES: 244 colour
AUTHORS: Hillman Curtis, Todd Purgason, Joe Lowery, Fred Sharples, Ian Kovalik, Brendan Dawes

The original version of 'Flash Web Design - The art of motion graphics' came out in March of last year. This latest release is essentially the same book but with updated Flash 5 actionscript and screen captures, courtesy of Brendan Dawes. If you already have the original then there's really not much here to justify shelling out again. If on the other hand you missed this one last time round then you may want to read on.

There are few people more qualified to write a book on Flash than Hillman Curtis. A former creative director of Macromedia, he has pioneered Flash and motion graphics on the web, and has garnered a shedload of awards along the way. This is not your average Flash book. It's a rare glimpse into the mind of an intelligent and skilful designer who just happens to use Flash.

I would go so far as to say that if you're already proficient with Flash then you are unlikely to learn a great deal from the code examples (despite the upgrade to v5) - but that isn't really the point. In this book the code is secondary. The real interest is to be found in Hillman's exposition of the design process rather than the tools he employs to execute it.

The production quality throughout is very high. Each page is illustrated in full colour with layout and design duties being handled by Steve Gifford and Todd Purgason. Todd also contributes to the last chapter in which he runs through the juxtinteractive pitching process and his multi-award winning Lundstrom & Associates web site.

Over nine chapters he walks you through a number of real world projects, sharing a great deal of his design methodology as he goes. The writing style is very open and informal and makes for easy reading. Each project is fully documented and includes some useful tutorials on importing video and audio as well as techniques for effective streaming. There are step by step instructions for Premiere, Freehand and SoundForge as well as Flash.

One slight niggle with this new update though. Although the Actionscript has been brought up to date,the Freehand examples are bizarelly still stranded in version 8. Go figure.

For seasoned veterans this is an interesting insight into Hillman's design process and for beginners there are some useful tips and source code. Ultimately though this book will be of greatest benefit to developers who have come to Flash from a programming background and are looking for a Flash book that will also give them a good introduction to 'design'.
