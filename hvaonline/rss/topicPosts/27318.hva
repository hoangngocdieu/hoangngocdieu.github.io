				<title>Kevin Mitnick - The true story</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ Based on the true story of the capture of computer hacker _KEVIN MITNICK_
KEVIN MITNICK is quite possibly the best hacker in the world.
Hunting for more and more information, seeking more and more cybertrophies every day, he constantly looks for bigger challenges.

<b>
Arrest, Conviction, and Incareceration</b>

After a well-publicized pursuit, the FBI arrested kevin Mitnick in his apartment in Raleigh, North Carolina Febuary of 1995 on federal offenses related to a 2½-year computer hacking spree. 
In 1999, Mitnick admitted to the authorities to four counts of wire fraud, two counts of computer fraud and one count of illegally intercepting a wire communication, as part of a plea agreement before the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison in addition to 22 months for violating the terms of his 1989 supervised release sentence for computer fraud. He admitted to violating the terms of supervised release by hacking into PacBell voicemail and other systems and to associating with known computer hackers, in this case codefendant Louis De Payne.
Mitnick served five years in prison, of which four and a half years were pre-trial, and eight months were in solitary confinement. He was released on January 21, 2000. During his supervised release, which ended on January 21, 2003, he was initially restricted from using any communications technology other than a landline telephone. Mitnick fought this decision in court which ruled in his favor, allowing him to access the Internet.
In addition, as per the plea deal, Mitnick was prohibited from profiting from films or books that are based on his criminal activity for a period of seven years.

Mitnick now runs Mitnick Security Consulting, a computer security consultancy.

<b>Early life</b>

Kevin Mitnick began social engineering, or perhaps discovered his first engineerable situation at the age of 12. He realized he could bypass the punchcard system used for the Los Angeles bus system: by buying his own punch, he could get free bus rides anywhere in the greater LA area. Social engineering became his primary method of obtaining information, whether it be user names and passwords, modem phone numbers or any number of other pieces of data.
In high school, he was introduced by "Petronix" to phone phreaking, the activity of manipulating telephones, which he often used to evade long distance charges. Mitnick also became handy with amateur radios; using such equipment, Mitnick reportedly managed to gain unauthorized access to the speaker systems of nearby fast food restaurants.

<b>Computer cracking</b>

Mitnick gained unauthorized access to his first computer network in 1979, when a friend gave him the phone number for the Ark, the computer system at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing their RSTS/E operating system software. He broke into DEC's computer network and copied DEC's software, he was charged and convicted in 1988. He was sentenced to twelve months in prison followed by a three year period of supervised release, near the end of his supervised release, Mitnick hacked into Pacific Bell voice mail computers. A warrant was issued for Mitnick’s arrest and he fled, becoming a fugitive for the next two and one half years. According to the DOJ, during this time, Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks using cloned cellular phones to hide his location and, among other things, stealing valuable proprietary software from some of the country’s largest cellular telephone and computer companies. Mitnick also intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke into and read private e-mail. Mitnick was apprehended in February 1995 in North Carolina. When arrested he was found with cloned cellular phones, over one hundred clone cellular phone codes, and multiple pieces of false identification. 

<b>Acts by Kevin Mitnick</b>

    * Using the Los Angeles bus transfer system to get free rides
    * Evading the FBI
    * Hacking into DEC system(s) to view VMS source code (DEC reportedly spent $160,000 in cleanup costs)
    * Gaining full admin privileges to an IBM minicomputer at the Computer Learning Center in LA in order to win a bet
    * Hacking Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu Siemens systems
    * Wiretapped FBI agents according to John Markoff,[7] although denied by Kevin Mitnick.

<b>Alleged</b>

    * Stole computer manuals from a Pacific Bell telephone switching center in Los Angeles
    * Read the e-mail of computer security officials at MCI Communications and Digital
    * Wiretapped the California DMV
    * Made free cell phone calls
    * Hacked SCO, PacBell, FBI, Pentagon, Novell, CA DMV, USC and Los Angeles Unified School District systems.

<b>Controversy</b>

Kevin Mitnick's criminal activities, arrest, and trial were controversial, as was the journalism surrounding his conviction.
Though Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully and possession of several forged identification documents, his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive. In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. Mitnick did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security
The controversy is highlighted by the differing views offered in two books: John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura's Takedown, and Jonathan Littman's The Fugitive Game. Littman made four notable allegations:

    * journalistic impropriety by Markoff, who had covered the case for the New York Times based on rumor and government claims, while never interviewing Kevin himself.
    * overzealous prosecution of Mitnick by the government
    * mainstream media over-hyping Mitnick's actual crimes
    * Shimomura's involvement in the matter being unclear or of dubious legality
The case against Mitnick tested then-nascent laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime, and it raised public awareness of security issues involving networked computers. The controversy remains, however, as Mitnick is often used today as an example of the quintessential computer criminal although his exploits are less notable than his notoriety suggests.
Supporters of Mitnick have asserted that many of the charges against him were fraudulent and not based on actual losses.

<b>Media</b>

In 2000, Skeet Ulrich and Russell Wong portrayed Kevin Mitnik and Tsutomu Shimomura in the movie Track Down. The DVD was released in September of 2004, The movie is based on the book Takedown by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura. 
Further controversy came over the release of the movie, with Littman alleging that portions of the film were taken from his book without permission.
Kevin is the author of two computer security books, The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders & Deceivers  and The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security
