				<title>[BMSA-2009-03] Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSite v2.1</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2009-03
===================================


:Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSite v2.1
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: OpenSite v2.1
:Fixed in: to be fixed in 3.0


Description
-----------

OpenSite is an Open Source Content Management System powered by PHP5 and MySQL 4 and is extremely simple and lightweight.

We have discovered six vulnerabilities in OpenSite from authentication bruteforce to SQL injection. Except the first vulnerability rated at critical severity, the rest is of low severity.

1. Weakened authentication.

The function ``init`` in ``origin/libs/user.php`` checks for a matching ``origin_hash`` cookie. However, this cookie can be bruteforced in at most 2^32 tries for a known username. In reality, the number of attempts could be greatly reduced knowing that we do not have to check for time in the future, and long past.

2. Special characters such as quotes, double quotes, backslashes in password prevent users from logging in.

In ``modules/userregister/index.php``, the argument passed to ``$user-&gt;register`` contains and escaped ``$_POST['password']``. In ``origin/libs/user.php``, this password is hashed with ``sha1``. However, the function ``login`` does not escape the POST data before hashing it, causing inconsistency.

3. Double escapes in user registraion.

In ``origin/libs/user.php``, the register function escapes all key=&gt;value pairs before inserting them into the database. However, ``username``, ``password``, and ``email`` have been escaped before being passed to this function. Therefore they are escaped twice.

4. SQL injection in admincp/includes/functions.php.

SQL injection in function ``haspermission``. The parameters ``$module`` and ``$section`` are not escaped. This function is called in ``admincp/usergroups.php``.

5. SQL injection in ``admincp/settings.php``.

SQL injection in processing ``$_POST['do'] == "save"``. The POST data ``settings`` are not properly escaped before saving.

6. SQL injection in ``admincp/usergroups.php``.

SQL injection in all permissions select command ``SELECT id,module,section,groups FROM permissions WHERE module='".$module."' AND section='".$section."' LIMIT 1"``. The POST data ``permissions`` are not properly escaped before use.

----------

There is no workaround.

These bugs are planned to be fixed in OpenSite v3.0.

				<description><![CDATA[ Xin lỗi trình kém không hiểu hết được , nhưng xin bác giải thích kỹ hơn một chút đước không ah. 
ví dụ như : 1. Weakened authentication. 

The function ``init`` in ``origin/libs/user.php`` checks for a matching ``origin_hash`` cookie. However, this cookie can be bruteforced in at most 2^32 tries for a known username. In reality, the number of attempts could be greatly reduced knowing that we do not have to check for time in the future, and long past.

vậy thì nó không brute force thì nó sẽ làm gì tiếp theo ngắt kết nối của mình luôn ah` , hay cho qua luon không cần hỏi han gì 


và bác có thể cho em một site để test hoặc google dork , OKIE]]></description>
