<blockquote>
Flash Player update available to address security vulnerabilities

Release date: July 10, 2007

Vulnerability identifier: APSB07-12

CVE number: CVE-2007-3456, CVE-2007-3457, CVE-2007-2022

Platform: All platforms
Summary

Critical vulnerabilities have been identified in Adobe Flash Player that could allow an attacker who successfully exploits these potential vulnerabilities to take control of the affected system. A malicious SWF must be loaded in Flash Player by the user for an attacker to exploit these potential vulnerabilities. Users are recommended to update to the most current version of Flash Player available for their platform.
Affected software versions

Adobe Flash Player 9.0.45.0 and earlier, 8.0.34.0 and earlier, and 7.0.69.0 and earlier.

To verify the Adobe Flash Player version number, access the About Flash Player page, or right-click on Flash content and select “About Adobe (or Macromedia) Flash Player” from the menu. If you use multiple browsers, perform the check for each browser you have installed on your system.
Solution

Adobe recommends all users of Adobe Flash Player 9.0.45.0 and earlier versions upgrade to the newest version 9.0.47.0 (Win, Mac, Solaris) or 9.0.48.0 (Linux), by downloading it from the Player Download Center, or by using the auto-update mechanism within the product when prompted.

For customers who cannot upgrade to Adobe Flash Player 9, Adobe has developed a patched version of Flash Player 7. Please refer to the Flash Player update TechNote.
Severity rating

Adobe categorizes this as a critical issue and recommends affected users upgrade to version 9.0.47.0 (Win, Mac, Solaris) or 9.0.48.0 (Linux).
Details

An input validation error has been identified in Flash Player 9.0.45.0 and earlier versions that could lead to the potential execution of arbitrary code. This vulnerability could be accessed through content delivered from a remote location via the user’s web browser, email client, or other applications that include or reference the Flash Player. (CVE-2007-3456)

An issue with insufficient validation of the HTTP Referer has been identified in Flash Player 8.0.34.0 and earlier. This issue does not affect Flash Player 9. This issue could potentially aid an attacker in executing a cross-site request forgery attack. (CVE-2007-3457)

The Linux and Solaris updates for Flash Player 7 (7.0.70.0) address the issues with Flash Player and the Opera and Konqueror browsers described in Security Advisory APSA07-03. These issues do not impact Flash Player 9 on Linux or Solaris. (CVE-2007-2022)&nbsp;

<blockquote>Sun(sm) Alert Notification

    * Sun Alert ID: 102934
    * Synopsis: Security Vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment Image Parsing Code May Allow a Untrusted Applet to Elevate Privileges
    * Category: Security
    *
      Product: Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition
    * BugIDs: 6483556, 6483560
    * Avoidance: Patch, Upgrade
    * State: Resolved
    * Date Released: 31-May-2007, 29-Jun-2007
    * Date Closed: 29-Jun-2007
    * Date Modified: 29-Jun-2007, 10-Jul-2007

1. Impact

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the image parsing code in the Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet or application to elevate its privileges. For example, an applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted applet.

A second vulnerability may allow an untrusted applet or application to cause the Java Virtual Machine to hang.

Sun acknowledges, with thanks, Chris Evans of the Google Security Team, for bringing these issues to our attention.

These issues are also referenced in the following documents:

CVE-2007-2788 at<span class="link"> http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2788</span>

CVE-2007-2789 at<span class="link"> http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2789</span>
2. Contributing Factors

These issues can occur in the following releases (for Windows, Solaris, and Linux):

First vulnerability:

    * JDK and JRE 6
    * JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 10 and earlier
    * SDK and JRE 1.4.2_14 and earlier
    * SDK and JRE 1.3.1_20 and earlier

Second vulnerability:

    * JDK and JRE 6
    * JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 10 and earlier
    * SDK and JRE 1.4.2_14 and earlier
    * SDK and JRE 1.3.1_19 and earlier

To determine the default version of the JRE on a system for Solaris and Linux, the following command can be run:

    % java -version

Note: The above command only determines the default version. Other versions may also be installed on the system.

To determine the default version of the JRE on a system for Windows:

   1. Click "Start"
   2. Select "Run"
   3. Type "cmd" (starts a command-line)
   4. At the prompt, type "java -version"

Note: The above command only determines the default version. Other versions may also be installed on the system.
3. Symptoms

There are no reliable symptoms that would show the described issues have been exploited.&nbsp;
