<blockquote>
Use Windows debuggers throughout the development cycle—and build better software

Rethink your use of Windows debugging and tracing tools—and learn how to make them a key part of test-driven software development. Led by a member of the Windows Fundamentals Team at Microsoft, you’ll apply expert debugging and tracing techniques—and sharpen your C++ and C# code analysis skills—through practical examples and common scenarios. Learn why experienced developers use debuggers in every step of the development process, and not just when bugs appear.

Discover how to:

Go behind the scenes to examine how powerful Windows debuggers work
Catch bugs early in the development cycle with static and runtime analysis tools
Gain practical strategies to tackle the most common code defects
Apply expert tricks to handle user-mode and kernel-mode debugging tasks
Implement postmortem techniques such as JIT and dump debugging
Debug the concurrency and security aspects of your software
Use debuggers to analyze interactions between your code and the operating system
Analyze software behavior with Xperf and the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) framework
