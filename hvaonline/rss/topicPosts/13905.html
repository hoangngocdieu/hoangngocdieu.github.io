<span class="link"> http://sectools.org/sec-distros.html</span>
Trong backtrack tổng hợp rất nhiều các công cụ quét lỗi mạng và hệ thống. Còn Knoppix có rất nhiều công sửa chữa, cứu hộ hệ thống. Còn Open BSD là HDH được bảo mật tốt nhất.]]></description>

<br>
			<div align="center" class="limitview"><img src='http://nst.sourceforge.net/nst/screenshots/screen011.png' border="0" onload="maxImg(this, 500px);" /></div>

The Network Security Toolkit is a bootable ISO live CD/DVD is based on Fedora 8. The toolkit was designed to provide easy access to best-of-breed Open Source Network Security Applications and should run on most x86 platforms.


This release is based on Fedora 8 using the Linux Kernel: "2.6.26.8-57.fc8". Here are some of the highlights for this release:

Enhanced the management of snort IDS systems via the NST WUI. It is much easier to setup a federation of snort IDS sensors with backend mysql IDS collector(s). 
The addition of the "WebDAV Resources" packages. This allows interacting with devices such as the Apple iPod touch using the Air Sharing application. 
Major updates to nmap and its related tools including better support in the NST WUI for managing nmap results. 
Added access terminal server functionality using minicom from the NST WUI. This allows one to manage and connect to many serial ports remotely. 
Enhanced the monitoring of serial data streams using the NST WUI. This includes detailed documentation and diagram. 
Support for saving and loading packet capture and display filters in the single and multi-tap network packet capture sections of the NST WUI. 
Added support scripts for using a USB modem to connect to the Sprint PCS Mobile Broadband service. 
Updated the NST WUI with support for taking GPS enhanced kismet capture files and producing KML output files which can be viewed in Google Earth or Google Maps. 
Many clean ups and minor enhancements have been made to the NST WUI. 
As always, the networking and security applications included have been updated to their latest version (See the "Change Log" for individual package updates).

				<title>10 Best Security Live CD Distros</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ homepage: http://zeltser.com/remnux/
mô tả:
REMnux incorporates a number of tools for analyzing malicious software that runs on Microsoft Windows, as well as browser-based malware, such as Flash programs and obfuscated JavaScript. The toolkit includes programs for analyzing malicious documents, such PDF files, and utilities for reverse-engineering malware through memory forensics.
REMnux can also be used for emulating network services within an isolated lab environment when performing behavioral malware analysis. As part of this process, the analyst typically infects another laboratory system with the malware sample and wwwects the connections to the REMnux system listening on the appropriate ports.
You can learn the malware analysis techniques that make use of the tools installed and pre-configured on REMnux by taking my course on Reverse-Engineering Malware (REM) at SANS Institute.
Originally released in 2010, REMnux has been updated to version 3 in December 2011.
