With C# Cookbook, 2nd Edition, you'll be able to learn and improve your mastery of both the C# language and the .NET platform. This updated bestseller has been completely revised to account for C# 2.0, the latest version of this popular object-oriented programming language. It also includes more than 100 new code solutions (over 300 overall) to common problems and tasks that you're sure to face as a C# programmer.

Nearly every solution, or "recipe," contains a complete, documented code sample showing you how to solve the specific problem, as well as a detailed discussion of how and why the underling technology works. This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of O'Reilly's "Cookbook" series can attest to. In fact, no other source offers a learn-as-you-go format quite like this.
C# Cookbook, 2nd Edition is organized into 20 chapters, each of which focuses on a particular topic in creating C# solutions. Here's just a taste of what's covered:
Numeric data types
Strings and characters
Classes and structures
Generics
Exception handling
Delegates, events, and anonymous methods

Filesystem interactions
Web site access
XML usage (including XPath and XSLT)
Networking
Threading
Unsafe code

Best of all, you don't have to be an experienced C# or .NET developer to use C# Cookbook, 2nd Edition. You just have to be someone who wants to solve a problem now, without having to learn all the related theory first.
