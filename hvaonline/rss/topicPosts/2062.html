A.MTU 
B.MAC 
C.FCS 
D.PDU 
E.ERR 
F. Flag 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Câu này thì tương đối dễ, đáp án đúng là FCS, trường FCS có 16 bit dùng để kiểm tra frame có bị lỗi hay không? Nó dùng thuật toán hàng & cột để kiểm tra. Nó chỉ phát hiện lỗi chứ không sửa lỗi.

<blockquote>25. How many usable sub network and usable hosts per subnet result in the network address 201.105.13.0 is sub netted with a mask of /26? 

A. 64 network and 4 hosts 
B. 4 network and 64 hosts 
C. 2 network and 62 hosts 
D. 62 network and 2 hosts 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Câu này thì đáp án đúng là câu :B
Vì nó có các subnet như sau :201.105.13.0/26 và 201.105.13.64/26,201.105.13.128/26 và 201.105.13.192/26

<blockquote>23. All WAN links is side the Contoso.com network use PPP with for authentication security. Which command will display the CHAP authentication process as it occurs between two routers in the network. 

A. show CHAP authentication 
B. show interface serial 0 
C. debug PPP authentication 
D. debug CHAP authentication 
E. show PPP authentication CHAP 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>
Đáp án là : debug ppp authentication


<blockquote>20. Exhibit: 

Given a Network with a switched topology as illustrated. What will be the result if the Spanning-Tree Protocol is disabled on all the switches? (Choose two) 

A. Broadcast Storm will occur. 
B. Broadcast Storm will be detected quickly. 
C. At least one link will be placed in standby. 
D. Loops will occur. 
E. Loops will be detected quickly.&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Hình như câu này có hình, đáp án đúng là: A và D 
Vì khi protocol Spaning-tree bị disable thì quá trình loop sẽ xảy ra và kết quả là bị "bão" Broadcast và Loop xảy ra.

Không biết đúng không các huynh.  :?:) 
<blockquote>19. Exhibit: 

After Configuring the router show in the exhibit, the from the technician's laptop to all of the interface on each router were successful, if a technician initiates a telnet session to Router Contoso1 and issues the show arp command, which of the following items will be among the entries displayed in the output? 

A. The MAC address of the S0 interface on Router Contoso1 
B. The MAC address of the E0 interface on Router Contoso1 
C. The MAC address of the S0 interface on Router Contoso2 
D. The MAC address of the E0 interface on Router Contoso2 &nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Câu này cũng có hình, đáp án đúng là MAC của Interface gần host nhất .
<blockquote>24. Which of the following if addresses can be assigned to host devices (Choose two) 

A. 205.7.8. 32/27 
B. 191.168. 10. 2/23 
C. 127.0.0.1 
D. 224.0.0.10 
E. 203.123.45. 47/28 
F. 10.10.0.0/13 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>
Câu này cũng có hình chỉ loại bỏ được các câu sau :
C. 127.0.0.1  đây là địa chỉ loopback .
D. 224.0.0.10 đây là địa chỉ Multicast
A. 205.7.8. 32/27  là địa chỉ SubNET
B. 191.168. 10. 2/23  này là Broadcast.
nên câu trả lời đúng là :E và F

Theo em câu D là câu trả lời đúng, không biết anh nào có ý kiến gì không ?
<blockquote>12. Which characteristics are representative of a link-state routing protocol? (Choose three)

B. Exchange routing tables with neighbors. 
C. Calculates shortest path. 
D. Utilizes event triggered updates. 
E. Utilizes frequent periodic updates. 

&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

CÂu này các câu đúng là : C&D&E
Vỉ giao thức định tuyến link-state không trao đổi bảng routing mà chỉ thay đổi database cho nhau, nó cũng dùng các HELLO packet để thông báo cho nhau trong thời gian định kì là 5s.

<blockquote>10. Which of the following options lists the steps in PPP session establishment in the correct order? 

A. Optional authentication phase, link establishment phase, network layer protocol phase. 
B. Network layer protocol phase, link establishment phase, optional authentication phase. 
C. Network layer protocol phase, optional authentication phase, link establishment phase. 
D. Link establishment phase, network layer protocol phase, optional authentication phase. 
E. Link establishment phase, optional authentication phase, network layer protocol phase. 
F. Optional authentication phase, network layer protocol phase, link establishment phase. 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Theo em thì câu D là câu trả lời đúng vì khi 1 session ppp được thiết lập thì quá trình đầu tiên là LCP sẽ kết nối đến IPCP kết nối sau đó mới chứng thực username & password.
<blockquote>9. What feature of a networks switch allows an administrative to create separate broadcast domains? 

A. Store-and-forward switching 
B. Micro segmentation 
C. Transparent bridging 
D. Fragment-free switching 
E. Virtual LANs 
F. Cut-through switching &nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Câu này thì em không chắc có trả lời đúng không ? Có lẽ câu B là đúng vì các broadcast domain sẽ được chia ra bởi các segment nhỏ.  :?:) ]]></description>

B. 4 network and 64 hosts 
C. 2 network and 62 hosts 
D. 62 network and 2 hosts 
  


Câu này thì đáp án đúng là câu :B 
Vì nó có các subnet như sau :201.105.13.0/26 và 201.105.13.64/26,201.105.13.128/26 và 201.105.13.192/26 
&nbsp;
		</blockquote>

Câu trả lời này em sai vì bỏ subnet đầu và subnet cuối , vậy đáp án đúng là câu C.
Theo cách tính /26 là mượn 2 bít làm host nên: 2^2-2 = 2 networks.
còn 6 bit làm host nên: 2^6-2 = 62 host.

71. Your boss at Contoso want you to brief him on differences and similarities between bridges and switches. What should you tell her? (Choose two)

A. Bridges are faster than switches because they have fewer ports. 
B. A switch is a multi port bridge, 
C. Bridges and switches learn MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of each frame received.

C. Networks can only remain fully converged if all information about routes is sent out all active interfaces. 
D. Information about a route should not be sent back in the direction from which the original update came.

A. Distance vector protocols send the entire routing table to directly connected neighbors. 
B. Link state protocols send the entire routing table to all routers in the network. 
C. Distance vector protocols send updates about directory connected neighbors to all networks listed in the routing table. 
D. Link state protocols send updates containing the state of their own links to all other routers on the network.

A. It increases the number of collisions. 
B. It decreases the number of broadcast domains. 
C. It connects segment 1's broadcasts to segment 2. 
D. It prevents segment 1's broadcasts from getting to segment 2.
