Written by the premier author in Windows administration, William Stanek, and addressing the needs of Windows 2003 administrators preparing for the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) exams, MCSE Core Required Exams in a Nutshell is invaluable. With the recent revisions of the MCSE exams including simulations, success is even more difficult. Not only does this book provide the resources administrators need to succeed on the exams, but to succeed in the real world as well. They can think of this book as the notes they would have highlighted and then recorded for every essential nugget of information related to the skills measured in Exams 70-290, 70-291, 70-293, and 70-294 (and by association Exams 70-292 and 70-296). 
To begin with, MCSE Core Required Exams in a Nutshell allows readers to see all of the topics expected for mastery in each of the exams. Then, each exam is covered in three parts: Exam Overview, Study Guide, and Test Your Knowledge sections. This makes for easy reference and a great study aid. 

The Exams covered include:

- EXAM 70-290: Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Environment 
- EXAM 70-291: Implementing, Managing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network Infrastructure 
- EXAM 70-293: Planning and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network Infrastructure 
- EXAM 70-294: Planning, Implementing, and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Infrastructure

Once they have completed the exams successfully, administrators will find the book to be a valuable reference to core Windows administration skills.
