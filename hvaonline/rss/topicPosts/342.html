vBulletin 3.6 Beta 3

A week has past since the public release of vBulletin 3.6 Beta 2 and the time is right to proceed to the next stage. vBulletin 3.6 Beta 3 contains a number of fixes and tweaks to the Beta 2 code and we recommend that anyone currently running Beta 2 should upgrade to Beta 3.

The first round of bugs found in 3.6 Beta 2 has for the most part been simple and quick to fix, so we are hopeful that this will not be a particularly long beta process. However, there are a number of bugs awaiting feedback - please check the bug tracker regularly to see if the developers require further input or feedback on bugs you have reported.

New Stuff

Improved Image Verification - Fetch New Image if Unreadable
If you are having problems reading the Captcha image (image verification system), you can now click the image to fetch a new image without reloading the page.

cURL Support in RSS Poster
cURL will now be used by the RSS poster, if it is available. This allows more feeds to be fetched, including those on secure sites, and allows additional problems to be handled behind-the-scenes.

The Usual Important Stuff

This is beta software. If you are not fully at home with backing-up and restoring your forum, dealing with bugs and regular upgrades, do not install this beta version.

* Beta software is unsupported and you install beta versions at your own risk.
* Some minor bugs remain unresolved at this time, so beta software should not be on production sites.
* You should always back up your database fully before attempting to install beta software.
* If you choose to install this version, you should be aware that we plan to release new beta versions in rapid succession as bugs are fixed and holes are plugged. Do not install this beta version if you are not willing or able to keep up-to-date with new releases.
* The ImpEx import system does not support the 3.6 code yet, and will not support it until the release of 3.6.0 (stable).

Installation / Upgrade
If you are accustomed to the install and upgrade procedure used by vBulletin 3.5 then the 3.6 install and upgrade process will be familiar to you.
Please refer to an earlier release announcement for full instructions.

Hacking / Plugins
While there have not been extensive changes to the underlying architecture of vBulletin 3.6 from 3.5, it is possible that certain hooks may have changed. Therefore you should check with the author of whatever plugins and products to attach to your vBulletin installation to inquire about their compatibility with vBulletin 3.6. Plugin authors should be assured that we do not anticipate major code changes between the Beta 1 code and the final 3.6.0 code, so plugins written for or adapted to 3.6 compatibility should still work with the final code.

Javascript / AJAX Problems
Many of the Javascript files for vBulletin 3.6 have changed. However, if templates are reverted or adapted correctly there should be no issue with cached old Javascript files, as we have implemented a system that should force clients to reload Javascript files after an upgrade. If you discover what you believe to be a Javascript problem, please ensure that you are not using cached files by doing a ctrl+F5 hard refresh before reporting it as a bug.

Reporting Bugs
Please use the vBulletin 3.6 Bug Tracker to report any bugs you find in vBulletin 3.6.
