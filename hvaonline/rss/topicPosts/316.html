The definitive guide to penetrating and defending wireless networks.
Written by the best in the industry! A must have!! (blackdragonz's humble opinion)

Straight from the field, this is the definitive guide to hacking wireless networks. Authored by world-renowned wireless security auditors, this hands-on, practical guide covers everything you need to attack -- or protect -- any wireless network.

The authors introduce the 'battlefield,' exposing today's 'wide open' 802.11 wireless networks and their attackers. One step at a time, you'll master the attacker's entire arsenal of hardware and software tools: crucial knowledge for crackers and auditors alike. Next, you'll learn systematic countermeasures for building hardened wireless 'citadels''including cryptography-based techniques, authentication, wireless VPNs, intrusion detection, and more.

Coverage includes:

- Step-by-step walkthroughs and explanations of typical attacks
- Building wireless hacking/auditing toolkit: detailed recommendations, ranging from discovery tools to chipsets and antennas
- Wardriving: network mapping and site surveying
- Potential weaknesses in current and emerging standards, including 802.11i, PPTP, and IPSec
- Implementing strong, multilayered defenses
- Wireless IDS: why attackers aren't as untraceable as they think
- Wireless hacking and the law: what's legal, what isn't
- If you're a hacker or security auditor, this book will get you in. If you're a netadmin, sysadmin, consultant, or home user, it will keep everyone else out.
