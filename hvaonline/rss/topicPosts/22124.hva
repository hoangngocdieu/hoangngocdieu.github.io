Practical REST on Rails 2 Projects is a guide to joining the burgeoning
world of open web applications. It argues that opening up your
application can provide significant benefits and involves you in the
entire process—from setting up your application, to creating clients for
it, to handling success and all its attendant problems.
- This book is the essential resource for anyone who wants to make
their web application a full participant in the new Internet.
- This book is intended for intermediate–to–advanced Rails
developers—people who use Rails regularly for sites and applications
more complicated than the prototypical roll–your–own blog.
- In particular, it’s targeted at Rails developers who want to be good
Web 2.0 citizens—sharing the functionality of their app with other sites
to the betterment of everyone.

- Application projects include iPhone, Facebook, and REST for the
enterprise.

What you’ll learn:

- Develop REST web services in Rails 2 Framework.
- Build from the server–side perspective and integrate with PHP.
- Build from the client side using a JavaScript widget.
- Develop RESTful application on Rails for the Apple iPhone.
- Create a Facebook application using REST on Rails.
- Examine REST on Rails for the Enterprise.
