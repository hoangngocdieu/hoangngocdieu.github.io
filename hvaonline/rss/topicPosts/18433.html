The First In-Depth, Real-World, Insider's Guide to Powerful Windows
Debugging

For Windows developers, few tasks are more challenging than
debugging—-or more crucial. Reliable and realistic information about
Windows debugging has always been scarce. Now, with over 15 years of
experience two of Microsoft's system-level developers present a thorough
and practical guide to Windows debugging ever written.

Mario Hewardt and Daniel Pravat cover debugging throughout the entire
application lifecycle and show how to make the most of the tools
currently available—-including Microsoft's powerful native debuggers and
third-party solutions.

To help you find real solutions fast, this book is organized around
real-world debugging scenarios. Hewardt and Pravat use detailed code
examples to illuminate the complex debugging challenges professional
developers actually face. From core Windows operating system concepts to
security, Windows(r) Vista™ and 64-bit debugging, they address emerging
topics head-on—and nothing is ever oversimplified or glossed over!

This book enables you to:

- Master today's most powerful Windows debugging tools, including
NTSD, CDB, WinDbg, KD, and ADPlus
- Debug code that wasn't designed or written for easy debugging
- Understand debuggers “under the hood,” and manage symbols and
sources efficiently
- Debug complex memory corruptions related to stacks and heaps
- Resolve complex security problems
- Debug across processes: identity tracking, RPC debugger extensions,
and tracking IPCs with Ethereal
- Find and fix resource leaks, such as memory and handle leaks.
- Debug common thread synchronization problems
- Learn when and how to write custom debugger extensions
- Perform “postmortem debugging” using crash dumps and Windows Error
Reporting
- Automate debugging with DebugDiag and the Analyze Debugger command

Whether you're a system-level or application developer, Advanced Windows
Debugging delivers the deep understanding of debugging that could save
you weeks on your very next project.
