Book Description
· Understand the inner workings of TCP/IP
· Implement a Web server with dynamic content generation and client/server data transfer capabilities
Internet programming demystified! This is a hands-on guide to TCP/IP networking that includes platform-independent source code to a simple TCP/IP stack - a lean version that is easier to present and efficient enough to use in embedded applications.

Create a small, stand-alone TCP/IP stack with an embedded Web server. Aided by the author’s abundant source code examples and fully-functional utilities, you will learn about, and experiment with, the simpler aspects of internetworking, before tackling the TCP protocol itself. The author offers an intensely practical approach, while still providing an in-depth understanding of the TCP/IP protocol family. At each stage of the book, you will consolidate your understanding through experimentation with suitable software utilities. Along the road to mastering the creation of complex network software, you will:

· learn about key networking and client/server technologies
· experiment with networked PCs and microcontrollers
· explore and extend the professionally-written software
· build the protocols from the ground up
· speed your network development with a powerful set of tools and utilities

Implement dynamic content generation and client/server data transfers for network appliances. This book meets the challenge of implementing a Web server on small-scale embedded systems, providing full C source code for the PC hardware platform, PIC16xxx, and PIC18xxx microcontrollers. The PICmicro® software is fully compatible with Microchip’s PICDEM.net demonstration board. The Web server functionality has been expanded in this edition to include DHCP auto-configuration, PPP serial links, UDP and TCP client/server programming, SMTP and POP3 email support.

A hands-on guide to TCP/IP networking, teaching the reader how to create a standalone TCP/IP stack with an embedded Web server as well as a host of other tasks. The CD-ROM contains the necessary software which is compatible with several popular C compilers.
