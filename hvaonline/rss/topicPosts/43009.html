<blockquote>
Start developing robust drivers with expert guidance from the teams who developed Windows Driver Foundation. This comprehensive book gets you up to speed quickly and goes beyond the fundamentals to help you extend your Windows development skills. You get best practices, technical guidance, and extensive code samples to help you master the intricacies of the next-generation driver model—and simplify driver development.

Discover how to:

Use the Windows Driver Foundation to develop kernel-mode or user-mode drivers
Create drivers that support Plug and Play and power management—with minimal code
Implement robust I/O handling code
Effectively manage synchronization and concurrency in driver code
Develop user-mode drivers for protocol-based and serial-bus-based devices
Use USB-specific features of the frameworks to quickly develop drivers for USB devices
Design and implement kernel-mode drivers for DMA devices
Evaluate your drivers with source code analysis and static verification tools
Apply best practices to test, debug, and install drivers
