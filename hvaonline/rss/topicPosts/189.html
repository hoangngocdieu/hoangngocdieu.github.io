Advanced Web-Based Training Strategies fills the gap in the literature available on this topic by offering a volume that includes meaningful, applicable, and proven strategies that can take the experienced instructional designer to the next level of web-based training. Written by Margaret Driscoll and Saul Carliner -- internationally acclaimed experts on e-learning and information design- -- Advanced Web-Based Training Strategies provides instructional designers, e-learning developers, technical communicators, students, and others with strategies for addressing common challenges that arise when designing e-learning. Balancing educational theory with the practical realities of implementation, Driscoll and Carliner outline the benefits and limitations of each strategy, discuss the issues surrounding the implementation of these strategies, and illustrate each strategy with short scenarios drawn from real-world online learning programs representing a wide variety of fields including technology, financial services, health care, and government.
